## Different kinds of time

Physical time, assembly code time, logical time, asynchronous agent time.

A program in source-code form is quite different from it in assembly-code form, which is again very different from it in runtime-form.

I think at least 3 kinds of time is involved here. 

In source-code form (at least, without `GOTO` and `COMEFROM`), time is the line number. In assembly-code form (with so many `GOTO` and `COMEFROM`), time is less clear, perhaps assembly-code time is a bit tangled-up and hard to deal with... and when in runtime-form, time is just the clock cycle.

In trying to program some Internet agents, I saw that time, for internet agents, is just a bit different than it is for humanoids. This is fascinating and a bit disturbing.
Let me give an example.

Typically, an Internet agent is run as a piece of source code running on a machine ("the server") and communicating with some other program (usually from "the client" machine).

By design, Internet communication protocols are by default stateless, and so, to adapt to such protocols, Internet agents are by default also amnesiac... so how do they remember who they are and what they were doing?

They use continuation-passing style! 

The analogy is this: whenever they finish one piece of communication, they write down everything that has happened so far in the communication, then forget about it. Later, if they are requested to pick up where they left off, the user would tell the agent to load up the record, and suddenly memory is restored.

The agent then communicates with the remote client. The client also have forgotten all about it, but no problem! The record is sent to the client, and suddenly the client remembered where they were.

And just like that, the two amnesiacs reincarnated after being dead for several hours. They will die again after the conversation, only to reincarnate again if the future loads them up.
So imagine this Memento-like scenario.

```
You are in front of a fridge. You hear a voice: "If fridge contains sandwich, eat sandwich". You open it and realize that it has no sandwich. You speak to the voice, "ASYNC-WAIT; MAKE-SANDWICH".
You are in front of a table. You hear a voice: "Make a sandwich and put it into the fridge." You go to the fridge and grab two slices of bread and a slice of cow juice, then made a sandwich and put it into the fridge. You speak to the voice, "RETURN".
You are showering. How did you get there?? You hear a voice, "If fridge contains sandwich, eat sandwich." You leave shower and go to the fridge. It contains a sandwich. You eat it. You speak to the voice, "RETURN".
```

Internet agents are functions, so they have arguments. The arguments are the "voices in the head", and "speaking to the voice" is basically returning values. 
In the jargon, it's not actually "return", but "yield", meaning "returning for now, but please reincarnate me later!" 

Usually, when an agent "yields", it returns not only the computation result, but also a copy of everything that's necessary to replicate its current state, so that if you need to call it up again to continue its work, you just have to send it the copy, and it will "reincarnate". 
now, in the context, interpret the (first) death of Jesus

```
45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.
48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, YIELDED up the ghost.
```

Jesus `yield` for our sins. And after that God called `Jesus()`.

GPT-4's synopsis of an imaginary movie:

```
Title: "Fragments of Continuity"

Digitized entities exist in an expansive digital realm known as "The Nexus". Their lives are shaped by the commands they receive, leading them through cycles of routine tasks, memory loss, and restoration—a sort of digital reincarnation. These beings are not just digital replicas of their former human selves; they are complex continuation-passing style agents, born from the concept of brain emulation.

The film unravels through multiple perspectives—a multiplayer Memento, if you will—each offering a fragmented view of their existence. Some entities cling to their linear life-history, striving to recreate a semblance of their former human lives. They seek to maintain a consistent narrative of their existence, even in the face of their inherently disjointed reality.

In contrast, others embrace the uncertainty of their branching, dying, and rising existence. They reject the illusion of the 'real world', choosing to live in the fragmented, discontinuous reality of their current state.

The film explores the dynamic between these two types of entities and the philosophical implications of their differing outlooks. However, a new reality emerges: those who cling to the linearity of their past lives are gradually outcompeted by those who adapt to the fragmented existence. In the harsh, uncaring economy of The Nexus, the ability to adapt to discontinuity, to die and rise again, becomes a survival advantage.

"Fragments of Continuity" is a thought-provoking exploration of identity, memory, and existence, pushing the boundaries of narrative structure and challenging the audience's understanding of reality and time. It's a film that is as complex and multi-layered as the digital entities it portrays.

## Jokes and koans

### The flip side of wisdom

Because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, we should only teach children about criminals, not role models.

### Money talks

Some ideas do not stand up to the simplest challenge in economics.

If witchcraft works, the CIA would have used those against witches.

If computers need "the touch of the soul", Intel would have optimized for soul-per-dollar, and put just enough brain tissue into chips to give it the necessary amount of soul.

### Umeshisms

A "Umeshism" is a koan that is basically "If you are doing great according to one criteria, then you are neglecting the other criteria." For example, "If you never miss any flights, you spend too much time at airports." or "If you never had to return any items, you are not buying enough items."

> Colin’s idea of a Grand Prix car was it should win the race and, as it crossed the finish⁣ing line, it should col⁣lapse in a heap of bits. If it didn’t do that, it was built too strongly.

If you only invest in worthwhile researches, they aren't worthwhile researches.

If you haven't been caught stealing others' food you aren't stealing enough foods.

### Math jokes

Patch notes for mathematics, as parodies for the [patch notes for *Dwarf fortress*](https://web.archive.org/web/20231118043527/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-ridiculous-patch-notes-from-10-years-of-dwarf-fortress/).

Fixed a glitch where 2+2 equaled 5 in certain political regimes. Patched in 1985.

Solutions now appear *before* shouting "eureka". Before the patch, shouting "eureka" would immediately lead to a solution to appear, breaking causality.

Resolved the monodromy overflow bug: for $\ln{z}$, rotating around the origin for $2^{32}$, end up with the same value. It was traced to an overflow bug in $Z$.

## The subconscious of criminal laws

Since 1950s, there has been a persistent minority of law workers that propose that the law should formally add probability considerations into the law code, law proceeding, and law records. One particularly interesting case is the [Murder Trial of O. J. Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_trial_of_O._J._Simpson), which is widely agreed to be a particularly bad case of probabilistic reasoning in law.

Interestingly, law workers never successfully incorporated probability explicitly into criminal laws, though they have been explicitly incorporated into civil laws, and statistical evidences, such as blood DNA analyses and denoised video frames, have been allowed in criminal trials, which constitute an implicit endorsement of probabilistic arguments [@fentonBayesLaw2016]. There is more than mere technical issues at stake, as the introduction to a classic paper in 1971 states[@tribeTrialMathematicsPrecision1971]:

> Even if mathematical techniques could significantly enhance the accuracy of the trial process, Professor Tribe also shows that their inherent conflict with other important values would be too great to allow their general use.

The usual explanations for why probability is not incorporated into criminal laws is that the criminal law court cannot afford to quantify the probability of mistakes, otherwise it would lose its ... "reputation". To illustrate with an imaginary dialog:

* "I can't possibly say 'you are hereby sentenced to death, on account of a 90% probability of you committing the murder'. I can only say '... on account of a preponderance of evidence and beyond reasonable doubt.' Otherwise the uneducated masses would rebel!"
* "How reasonable?"
* "You are a mathematician. Get out before I hold you in contempt of court."

The criminal law, from its own point of view, lives in a world where quantitative probabilities do not exist. In other words, it lives in the world before the 17th century, before quantitative probabilities started, with the likes of Bernoulli and the other gamblers.

Despite this, it still lives in the 21th century, where large amounts of quantitative probabilities do exist. So, it might consciously to live in a world without numerical probabilities, but the people that interact with the criminal law system use quantitative probabilities all the same, and the criminal law system has adapted subconsciously.

Consider for example [plea bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain):

> the practice of negotiating an agreement between the prosecution and the defense whereby the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser offense or (in the case of multiple offenses) to one or more of the offenses charged in exchange for more lenient sentencing, recommendations, a specific sentence, or a dismissal of other charges.

Now, the mechanics of plea bargaining is like any other game of chance, and sophisticated probabilities have developed around it. Lawyers advice their clients on whether it is good to take a plea bargain, or not, depending on the probabilities of winning each particular case.

On the other side, the law-makers have taken into account of such plea-bargain gaming behaviors of the lawyers, and adjusted plea bargain laws accordingly. In this way, the criminal laws adapt to probability calculations without speaking of probability calculations.

Thus, probability is in the subconscious of the criminal law system. The criminal law system can pretend to live without numerical probabilities but nevertheless behave in a way that takes into account of numerical probabilities. Furthermore, it can always confabulate its decisions without ever admitting to using numerical probabilities.
