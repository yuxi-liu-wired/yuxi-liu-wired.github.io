## Jokes and koans

### The flip side of wisdom

Because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, we should only teach children about criminals, not role models.

### Money talks

Some ideas do not stand up to the simplest challenge in economics.

If witchcraft works, the CIA would have used those against witches.

If computers need "the touch of the soul", Intel would have optimized for soul-per-dollar, and put just enough brain tissue into chips to give it the necessary amount of soul.

### Umeshisms

A "Umeshism" is a koan that is basically "If you are doing great according to one criteria, then you are neglecting the other criteria." For example, "If you never miss any flights, you spend too much time at airports." or "If you never had to return any items, you are not buying enough items."

> Colin’s idea of a Grand Prix car was it should win the race and, as it crossed the finish⁣ing line, it should col⁣lapse in a heap of bits. If it didn’t do that, it was built too strongly.

If you only invest in worthwhile researches, they aren't worthwhile researches.

If you haven't been caught stealing others' food you aren't stealing enough foods.

### Math jokes

Patch notes for mathematics, as parodies for the [patch notes for *Dwarf fortress*](https://web.archive.org/web/20231118043527/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-most-ridiculous-patch-notes-from-10-years-of-dwarf-fortress/).

Fixed a glitch where 2+2 equaled 5 in certain political regimes. Patched in 1985.

Solutions now appear *before* shouting "eureka". Before the patch, shouting "eureka" would immediately lead to a solution to appear, breaking causality.

Resolved the monodromy overflow bug: for $\ln{z}$, rotating around the origin for $2^{32}$, end up with the same value. It was traced to an overflow bug in $Z$.

## The subconscious of criminal laws

Since 1950s, there has been a persistent minority of law workers that propose that the law should formally add probability considerations into the law code, law proceeding, and law records. One particularly interesting case is the [Murder Trial of O. J. Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_trial_of_O._J._Simpson), which is widely agreed to be a particularly bad case of probabilistic reasoning in law.

Interestingly, law workers never successfully incorporated probability explicitly into criminal laws, though they have been explicitly incorporated into civil laws, and statistical evidences, such as blood DNA analyses and denoised video frames, have been allowed in criminal trials, which constitute an implicit endorsement of probabilistic arguments [@fentonBayesLaw2016]. There is more than mere technical issues at stake, as the introduction to a classic paper in 1971 states[@tribeTrialMathematicsPrecision1971]:

> Even if mathematical techniques could significantly enhance the accuracy of the trial process, Professor Tribe also shows that their inherent conflict with other important values would be too great to allow their general use.

The usual explanations for why probability is not incorporated into criminal laws is that the criminal law court cannot afford to quantify the probability of mistakes, otherwise it would lose its ... "reputation". To illustrate with an imaginary dialog:

* "I can't possibly say 'you are hereby sentenced to death, on account of a 90% probability of you committing the murder'. I can only say '... on account of a preponderance of evidence and beyond reasonable doubt.' Otherwise the uneducated masses would rebel!"
* "How reasonable?"
* "You are a mathematician. Get out before I hold you in contempt of court."

The criminal law, from its own point of view, lives in a world where quantitative probabilities do not exist. In other words, it lives in the world before the 17th century, before quantitative probabilities started, with the likes of Bernoulli and the other gamblers.

Despite this, it still lives in the 21th century, where large amounts of quantitative probabilities do exist. So, it might consciously to live in a world without numerical probabilities, but the people that interact with the criminal law system use quantitative probabilities all the same, and the criminal law system has adapted subconsciously.

Consider for example [plea bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain):

> the practice of negotiating an agreement between the prosecution and the defense whereby the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser offense or (in the case of multiple offenses) to one or more of the offenses charged in exchange for more lenient sentencing, recommendations, a specific sentence, or a dismissal of other charges.

Now, the mechanics of plea bargaining is like any other game of chance, and sophisticated probabilities have developed around it. Lawyers advice their clients on whether it is good to take a plea bargain, or not, depending on the probabilities of winning each particular case.

On the other side, the law-makers have taken into account of such plea-bargain gaming behaviors of the lawyers, and adjusted plea bargain laws accordingly. In this way, the criminal laws adapt to probability calculations without speaking of probability calculations.

Thus, probability is in the subconscious of the criminal law system. The criminal law system can pretend to live without numerical probabilities but nevertheless behave in a way that takes into account of numerical probabilities. Furthermore, it can always confabulate its decisions without ever admitting to using numerical probabilities.
