## Introduction

In the novel *Blindsight* [@wattsFirefall2017], when humans made first contact with an alien probe, the alien probe attacked after a long conversation. The humans interpreted that this way: The alien probe could not understand some of human speech, and concluded that it was an informational attack specifically made to confuse it.

> Imagine that you encounter a signal. It is structured, and dense with information. It meets all the criteria of an intelligent transmission. Evolution and experience offer a variety of paths to follow, branch-points in the flowcharts that handle such input. Sometimes these signals come from conspecifics who have useful information to share, whose lives you'll defend according to the rules of kin selection. Sometimes they come from competitors or predators or other inimical entities that must be avoided or destroyed; in those cases, the information may prove of significant tactical value. Some signals may even arise from entities which, while not kin, can still serve as allies or symbionts in mutually beneficial pursuits. You can derive appropriate responses for any of these eventualities, and many others.

### Signaling games

> Brains are survival engines, not truth detectors. If self-deception promotes fitness, the brain lies. Stops noticing — irrelevant things. Truth never matters. Only fitness. By now you don't experience the world as it exists at all. You experience a simulation built from assumptions. Shortcuts. Lies. Whole species is agnosiac by default. Rorschach does nothing to you that you don't already do to yourselves.

## Chinese

The Chinese government has a mature system for information warfare. It has four main components. I do not know how they are usually termed, so I will describe them in my own language.

* The espionage component. This component is a typical one. Most large governments have an intelligence agency whose job is to discover the secrets of foreign governments. Compared to the espionage of developed countries like America, Chinese espionage has a strong focus on industrial and technological espionage.
* The internal component. This is the largest component in terms of the number of people employed.
* The expat component. This component has the main goal of maintaining support from the Chinese expat and foreign student community.
* The foreigner component. This component is the smallest and the least important. Its main goal is to create general support for the Chinese government among people who are not Chinese citizens or descendants. Its activities are mainly restricted to creating bland "cultural enrichment" videos.

This section mainly discusses the internal component. The expat and foreign components are rather minor, and there is too little reliable information about the espionage component to write that section.

### Internal operations

Internally, there are several main types of operations [@kingHowChineseGovernment2017]:

* Direct content silencing: As all Chinese websites and ISPs are registered with the local government, essentially any content on the Chinese Internet can be silenced at will by the Chinese government. This weapon can be as precise as disallowing replies to a single post for a limited period, or as blunt as deleting entire websites.
* Direct account silencing: As a simple extension of direct content silencing, any account can be silenced at will. This can be as precise as muting a single account for a week, or as blunt as deleting all accounts that has used hashtags from a list.
* The Great Firewall: The most famous of all. This blocks certain connections between the Chinese Internet and the external Internet.
* Noise injection: This is a blunt instrument. Like a cuttlefish injecting ink, people employed by the Chinese government or the social media websites post "noise" to dilute potentially dangerous information to a low level.
* Opinion guidance: This is a precise and subtle instrument used on particularly important topics.

Maintaining the stability of the regime is the final goal, but it is too vague to be of use. It is translated to the key instrumental goal of *preventing mass action*.

### The Great Firewall

In simplified terms, The Great Firewall eavesdrops on packets sent above the TCP layer, and replaces them with the TCP Reset packet when it detects possibly censorable content, for instance, when the IP address matches one of Google's many CDN server addresses. This ends the TCP connection between the client and the server. It is most often used to terminate connections between a client inside the Chinese Internet and a server outside the Chinese Internet, although it can also operate in the other direction. It can also perform other packet replacement than just a TCP Reset packet, as in *the Great Cannon*.

### Noise injection

For those Chinese citizens who have nevertheless bypassed the Great Firewall, they may organize mass action on foreign social media, such as Twitter, that are not directly censorable by the Chinese government. In those instances, noise injection is the main tactic.

During November and December of 2022, a wave of protests swept through China. To dampen the probability of mass action, the Chinese government activated Twitter accounts designed specifically for noise injection.

[Twitter grapples with Chinese spam obscuring news of protests - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/27/twitter-china-spam-protests/)

> Numerous Chinese-language accounts, some dormant for months or years, came to life early Sunday and started spamming the service with links to escort services and other adult offerings alongside city names. The result: For hours, anyone searching for posts from those cities and using the Chinese names for the locations would see pages and pages of useless tweets instead of information about the daring protests as they escalated to include calls for Communist Party leaders to resign.

### Public opinion guidance

[間 (*Ma*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_(negative_space)) is the Japanese art of negative space. Because the spread of censorship is so extensive, any opinion with an extensive following on the Chinese Internet is the negative space of censorship, and any opinion that seems like it should have some following online, but not voiced, is the negative space of speech. This gives us four layers of Chinese opinions:

* Officially endorsed opinion, as declared in published documents. This includes items such as Xi Jinping Thought, anti-historical nihilism.
* Officially allowed opinion, the negative space of censorship.
* Officially disallowed opinion, the negative space of speech.
* Officially forbidden opinion, as declared in published documents. This includes items such as [Historical Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_nihilism).

The first and last items, being officially declared, are overt and easy to point to. The middle two items are by nature ambiguous and difficult to study. It is as if they are already camouflaged for the information battlefield. The use of two negative spaces is an officially endorsed strategy, called "public opinion guidance" (舆论引导).

The Great Translation Movement picks only the common kinds of ugly text to translate. On the Chinese internet, survival is pretty much official approval. While on Twitter, Nazism might survive with heavy camouflage, it is not American official approval; yet on Weibo, Nazism survives with minor or no camouflage -- that is Chinese official toleration (if not outright approval). 

In 2022, when Shizo Abe was assassinated, the Chinese internet [erupted into cheers](https://web.archive.org/web/20231126215143/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/684006.html). Such cheers are only weakly balanced by those who want to respect the dead. While the cheers still remain online one year later (as [a brief search of the hashtag `#安倍已无生命体征#` on Weibo on 2023-12-16 showed](https://archive.is/icMNX)), subtle suggestions that a *certain somebody else* should be dead were swiftly suppressed within a day.

[Shinzo Abe death: Chinese journalist attempted suicide after being cyberbullied for emotional reportage | The Independent](https://web.archive.org/web/20220805014645/https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/zeng-ying-suicide-shinzo-abe-b2128922.html)

> Zeng Ying was brutally trolled by Chinese netizens for sobbing while reporting live on Shinzo Abe’s assassination earlier this month. She was forced to apologize for being “unprofessional,” for “showing personal emotion on a public platform” and “hurting everyone’s feelings”.

Gwern proposed a [Chinese Censorship Audit](https://gwern.net/idea#chinese-censorship-audit).

### External operations

The internal component is focussed on maintaining the stability of the regime by targeting the information faced by Chinese citizens. This does not mean that its operations are restricted to the Chinese Internet.

Since 2015, the Chinese government employed [the Great Cannon](https://web.archive.org/web/20231214165158/https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-great-cannon-has-been-deployed-again) multiple times to perform DDoS attacks. 

The Great Cannon is a Man-in-the-Middle DDoS attack. When an external IP address requests for certain JavaScript files hosted on certain servers located inside the Great Firewall[^typically-baidu], as the packet crosses the Great Firewall, a program makes a statistical decision. If the decision rule triggers, it replaces the innocuous JavaScript with a malicious JavaScript, which would rapidly send requests to a list of targeted servers. [@marczakAnalysisChinaGreat2015]

[^typically-baidu]: Typically, those are Baidu infrastructure servers that host commonly used analytics, social, or advertising scripts.

## Corporate

### Offensive

Among corporations, overt use of offensive information is rare now, as states have gradually consolidated its monopoly on violence. Towards customers, overt deception in advertisement is rare, although misdirection is common. Towards other corporations, overtly announcing deceptive information is possible, but not commonly employed (Why?).

### The economics of corporate censorship

The basic economy is simple: it cost them little to ban rare words that people use for acceptable uses, but a lot to not ban rare words that people use for not acceptable uses. So, on balance, most of the rare words that have unacceptable uses are banned. Most of the common words that have unacceptable uses are allowed. This is simple economy.

Censorship by private institutions (companies, websites, etc) is very different from official censorship (Chinese, intelligence agency, etc). For private institutions, censorship has the main economic goals:

* remove spam. Spam is defined as content that the intended customers do not want to see. This can usually be done by automated filters. See email spam filters.
* Remove things that might harm the public image. That is, removing content that the non-customers do not want to see. This is usually harder to do right since there is a somewhat different economy.
* Spam producers focus on economies of scale. Their goal is massive scaling, like spawning billions of eggs just for a few to survive and make money. Most of the spam emails are patently unbelievable, but since spam is so cheap they can focus on just scaling up the traffic and wait for a few victims. This makes spam filtering easy, and more resembles defending against DDoS than against information war. 

Writers who are trying to avoid censorship generally do not have economies of scale, since they are usually small producers making stuff for hobby or for small business. They have strong motivation and profit in bypassing censorship by trickery that doesn't scale (but they don't care because they do not use the large scale).

The economic equilibrium in the second case is what you get: the company uses simple censoring methods that balance between protecting the public image and driving away customers. The result is usually simple filter lists for rare words. The customers grumble but don't actually get so annoyed that they switch to a different service or platform, but instead make their own unscalable methods of trickery. Both sides talk vapidly about "harm" and "responsibility" and other crap I don't want to hear.

### Defensive

When corporations practice defensive information war, they typically practice it in the form of bland speech. 

::: {.callout-caution}
## Speculative content follows
:::

I suspect the increasingly opaque error messages used by websites are not due to incompetence, or a mistaken attempt at being user-friendly, but a design choice, a deliberate defense in their escalating information warfare against spammers.

This compares with the nondescript error messages of banks, where their vagueness is easier to explain: It is information defense against the possibility of leaking sensitive information.

[Seeing like a Bank](https://web.archive.org/web/20231210001242/https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/)

> In the specific case of “Why did the bank close my account, seemingly for no reason? Why will no one tell me anything about this? Why will no one take responsibility?”, the answer is frequently that the bank is following the law. As we’ve discussed previously, banks will frequently make the “independent” “commercial decision” to “exit the relationship” with a particular customer after that customer has had multiple Suspicious Activity Reports filed. SARs can (and sometimes must!) be filed for innocuous reasons and do not necessarily imply any sort of wrongdoing.
> 
> If the United States brings its subpoena power to bear against a bank teller and asks them about a SAR, they’re supposed to say nothing. That is the law... to avoid constantly violating this, Compliance at most functioning institutions has long-since decided that SARs will live in their own walled garden of a subsystem, seen only by the people responsible for drafting them and sending them to FinCEN.
> 
> That subsystems’ interactions with every other system are, of course, a site for extremely painful hilarity to happen. If, for example, a SAR is misfiled because that subsystem doesn’t share the same view of account ownership as another part of the overall system, investigating that problem might require telling the customer that they were investigated, which you cannot do. And because this is insufficiently Kafkaesque, at some financial institutions, you can get a SAR filed for knowing what a SAR is, because “advanced knowledge of anti-moneylaundering procedure” is a characteristic only of financial professionals and terrorists.

For example, I have found that in certain contexts, trying to use OAuth on my Google account would result in the one and only error message:

> Sorry, something went wrong there. Try again.

What is that "something"? Why can't Google provide any useful error message?

Some time ago, I attempted to buy a pepper spray on Amazon, and I simply could not get pass the age verification screen. Calling the customer service resulted in twenty minutes of wrangling with the website. It finally turned out that for some reason, the GUI on my end is different from the GUI on their end -- presumably just a backend server bug. Whereas on their end, the presumably correct GUI asks for the driver's license number as the only acceptable form of age verification, on my end I was able to use a passport number, which then the system rejected for not being a driver's license number.

While this in itself is frustrating but at least reasonable -- the Amazon website is vast and sprawling, and I understand enough about websites and programming to sympathize with the programmers who maintain it -- I was greatly annoyed that the only error message is just `Based on the ID number provided, we are unable to complete your order`.

Sometimes, I help others access or solve problems with e-commerce websites from within China, such as Taobao or Tmall. This form of highly nondescript error message is prevalent inside Chinese e-commerce websites, and as far as I can discern, is not caused by the Chinese-specific issue of censorship. Rather, they typically convey the message "According to our statistical analysis, you are sufficiently suspicious to trigger a statistical decision rule, but we won't tell you what, because if you were a bad actor we would not want you to know which of the things you did was suspicious.".

The convergence of behavior both inside and outside China suggests that it is not due to Chinese censorship, or lack thereof. It suggests that it is a common issue encountered by e-commerce, which suggests it is mostly intended to combat commercial spam.

Spammers are always attempting to bypass statistical detection of spammers, and on the other side, e-commerce websites are attempting to create statistical detectors of spammers. It is always a battle on the margin. For the e-commerce websites, the goal is not to stamp out spammers, or to ensure all legitimate users were accepted, but rather balance stamping out spammers, retaining legitimate users, and cost. The calculus of cost governs each aspect. In the equilibrium state, they occasionally ban legitimate users and then handle a fraction of those with manual interview. Each legitimate user grumbles but mostly acquiesces. Similarly, the marginal cost of losing a spam account is smaller than the marginal cost of going through a manual interview, so spammers would just open another account than go through the manual interview.

## Fictional

In fiction, there have been cases of "cognitohazard". However, their purported effects are much more overt than the somewhat subtle effects described in the essay. Whereas the information objects described in the essay redirect, confuse, camouflage, and waste the opponents' time, cognitohazards typically directly destroy the information-processing hardware of the opponents. In general, cognitohazards differ from the other examples, because they operate by breaking the abstraction layer. They are digital operations that causes analog operations that destroy the hardware. On the digital layer, the underlying hardware is assumed to be always there, like air before the discovery of vacuum. Cognitohazards pull out the air of the digital world and exposes the vacuum, destroying digital life in the process.

The short story *BLIT* (1988) [@langfordCOMPBASILISKFAQ1999] is the common reference point in discussions of cognitohazard, although it does not break the software-hardware abstraction barrier, and therefore is not a cognitohazard according to the definition here. In the story, human minds are essentially softwares running on brain-hardwares, and upon "Gödelian shock inputs"[^goedelian-shock], they fall into "vicious circles" from which they cannot recover. Many BLITs were discovered, with the first one described as resembling a fractal parrot.

[^goedelian-shock]: The story does not elaborate, but it is common knowledge among mathematical logicians that anything powerful enough for Peano arithmetics is powerful enough to be hacked. For example, [@dowlingThereAreNo1989] is a one-page proof that shows that "no program can both test its input for the presence of a virus and simultaneously be guaranteed not to spread a virus itself", by translating this statement into math, then quote [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem). The same argument can be used to show that "Gödelian shock inputs" must exist, assuming that human minds are softwares that can process arbitrary formulas in Peano arithmetics.

![](figure/blit_parrot.jpeg)

Real-life analogs of cognitohazards are extremely rare, and their status as "cognitohazards" is controversial. Nevertheless, here are some possible analogs.

The [McCollough effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect) shows that visual perception can be modified for up to 3 months with just a few minutes of visual stimulus. There have been several explanations, but none is satisfactory. They however all share the common idea that the visual stimulus itself changes the neurons in the low-level of perception.

Badly designed digital computers, such as the Zuse Z1 or Commodore PET, can suffer from the "[killer poke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_poke)".

The SCP world contains examples of anti-memetics, which are information objects that are hard to remember and reason about. They are not cognitohazards, but are rather camouflaged information.

## Rhetorics

An argument game is structured like a tennis game. Two sides stand facing each other, and hit the "point of the argument" back and forth. When one side finally "drops the ball", the other side wins the point. When seen this way, many puzzling aspects of argument games are explained.

Let's start with the simplest problem: Why is it that people have an urge to "have the last say"? To not drop the ball. If one side makes an argument, and the other does not offer a counter-argument, the round is assumed to be over and the first side won. If argument games are used to discover truths, this can get rather strange.

### The algorithmic fairness controversy

In 2019, I looked into the controversy over "algorithmic fairness" of the Northpointe COMPAS, which you can read [here](TODO). What was curious about the controversy is that neither side did it the way I would have done it. I would have just written out the simple mathematical model, then argued about which measure to choose. Instead, the actual controversy went like this:

* [ProPublica wrote a long article](TODO), putting in a lot of human faces for *pathos*.
* [Northpointe replied](TODO) tersely that the COMPAS system has good statistical properties.
* [ProPublica replied](TODO) with such detailed statistical arguments that I can only characterize as "statistical spam".

And here, the game stood. Who "won"? From my point of view, both sides missed the point completely and the whole game was moot. In fact I would rank ProPublica much lower than Northpointe for first using *pathos*, then using statistical spam. However, from a tennis game model of argument, ProPublica won, because Northpointe dropped the ball. Statistical spam is bad for discovering the truth, but a good play, because it is hard to counter-argue statistical spam. To the onlookers, they can use the controversy to have their own argument games, which would go as follows:

* A: "Haven't you heard of the algorithmic bias?"
* B: "Yes, but Northpointe made a counter-argument."
* A: "Well, ProPublica have shown that the counter-argument was statistically moot."
* And at that point, person B would have to admit defeat, attempt to actually parsing the statistical spam and then give up out of frustration, or dismiss the ProPublica statistical spam as irrelevant.

In my view, dismissing outright the ProPublica statistical spam is the right move, but it is going against the human intuition that whoever has the last say in an argument is in the right. People intuitively disdain "dismissing the last move" as childish cheating, much as shouting "That doesn't count!" in a tennis game.

## Continental philosophy

> [Bertrand Russell] thinks I am muddleheaded; but then I think he is simpleminded" 
> -- Alfred North Whitehead 

Continental philosophy presents another example of information warfare. The very definition of continental philosophy is tricky, especially if you want to respect the wishes of continental philosophers, who simultaneously want to build a coherent movement and want to reject all attempts at pigeonholing as inherently dehumanizing. Consequently, to keep the section clear, we will not respect the wishes of continental philosophers.

To begin, we start with the infamous passage "God is a Lobster" [@deleuzeThousandPlateausCapitalism1987, Chapter 3]:

> Challenger quoted a sentence he said he came across in a geology textbook. He said we needed to learn it by heart because we would only be in a position to understand it later on: "A surface of stratification is a more compact plane of consistency lying between two layers." The layers are the strata. They come at least in pairs, one serving as substratum for the other. The surface of stratification is a machinic assemblage distinct from the strata. The assemblage is between two layers, between two strata; on one side it faces the strata (in this direction, the assemblage is an inter stratum), but the other side faces something else, the body without organs or plane of consistency (here, it is a metastratum). In effect, the body without organs is itself the plane of consistency, which becomes compact or thickens at the level of the strata.
> 
> God is a Lobster, or a double pincer, a double bind. Not only do strata come at least in pairs, but in a different way each stratum is double (it itself has several layers). Each stratum exhibits phenomena constitutive of double articulation. Articulate twice, B-A, BA. This is not at all to say that the strata speak or are language based. Double articulation is so extremely variable that we cannot begin with a general model, only a relatively simple case. The first articulation chooses or deducts, from unstable particle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units (substances) upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and successions (forms).

A mathematician might look at this passage, and, if not immediately dismissing it as word salad, start writing down equations like $\exists G : G \in \text{Lobster}, \exists P : \text{isPincers}(G, P), \exists B, A: P = BAAB...$. They would then attempt to define an algebraic structure -- call it L-sequences, where L stands for "lobster" -- and try to construct examples of L-sequences. Deleuze and Guattari never make such an attempt.

> One of the fundamental tasks of the State is to striate the space over which it reigns, or to utilize smooth spaces as a means of communication in the service of striated space. It is a vital concern of every State not only to vanquish nomadism but to control migrations and, more generally, to establish a zone of rights over an entire “exterior,” over all of the flows traversing the ecumenon.

Torrents of garbage information flood the world every second, but they are simply ignored as noise. Continental philosophy is most assuredly not noise, even if they look kind of like noise. How do we explain their existence? I explain them as information objects with three aspects: the literal text, the actual practical use, and the rhetorical game mechanics.

The literal text of continental philosophy is typically made of complex sentences, and hard to understand, filled with allusions to past literature, word-plays, puns, neologisms, and foreign words. To interpret them coherently requires a strong concentration, patience, and having read a lot of the prerequisite texts. Consequently, such texts allow those few readers who can actually interpret them coherently a lot of bragging rights and all the pleasures of being in a society of esoteric wisdom. One can get a distinct feeling of this by going into the local university's philosophy department and eavesdrop on their late-night discussions, or going to an online forum of continental philosophy.

However, if they are merely hard to understand, they would not have more followers than modern set theory, which is equally complex and arcane [@fuchsSettheoreticGeology2015]: 

> Theorem 44: The generic mantle of $V$ is a definable transitive class in $V$, containing all ordinals, invariant under set forcing, and a model of the ZF axioms of set theory.
> 
> Proof: The generic mantle is a definable transitive class containing all ordinals and closed under the Gödel operations, because it is the intersection of the generic grounds, each of which has those closure properties in the corresponding extension of $V$. So by Fact 10, in order to show that $gM$ is an inner model, it remains to show merely that it is almost universal, which we do below...

Even a complete outsider to mathematics could quickly understand naive set theory, with an hour of tutorial on drawing circles and dots and Venn diagrams. Modern set theory, while a vast complication over the simple picture of Venn diagrams, is not different in kind. If the outsider looks at the paper on set-theoretic geology and asks "But what does it have to do with geology?", I can reply simply, "It is a one-way analogy. Set theorists noticed that they can start with ZF set theory and add the Axiom of Choice to get ZFC set theory, then add ZFC-consistency to get an even bigger set theory, and so on. So they thought 'What if we went the other way? Going down instead of up?' So they tried making smaller set theories below ZF set theory, and smaller, and smaller, all the way down the 'mantle' and below."

There we go, I have explained set-theoretic geology. Reading it, everyone can see that set-theoretic geology has no relevance to actual geology, anymore than the Conway's Game of Life has relevance to actual biology.

In comparison, continental philosophy is designed to be easily confused with practical issues. The 

Finally, continental philosophy occupies a particular niche in the game of rhetorics that allows it to [reproduce itself socially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reproduction).

Since its language is vague and suggestive, it seems relevant to any field, and so it can just walk into any tennis court uninvited and make an opening move. Since its language is dense and hard to distinguish from noise, the others might just ignore it, allowing it to declare victory by default. If someone responds, then the real fun begins.

| objection | response |
|----|----|
| This is irrelevant. | This problem is relevant to real people's real lives. |
| This philosophical argument is irrelevant to the real problem. | (Quote someone like the Frankfurt School.) |
| We do not talk about this topic in this style. | Open yourself to the challenges of alterity, lest you impose hegemonic reason. |
| Speak more simply. | Speaking simply is reductionistic. The real world is complex. |
| \[points at quote\] This is technically wrong. | You have misunderstood what the authors are really saying. Engage with the source respectfully instead of quoting them out of context. |

By repeatedly butting into any fashionable controversy of the day, continental philosophy keeps itself from falling into oblivion like modern set theory. By not losing the rhetorical game, it keeps itself from being debunked like old quantum theory. However, to complete its social reproduction, continental philosophy still has to keep itself from challenges from within.

Euclid's *Elements* was a compilation and cleaning-up of geometry books that came before it. It was of such fine quality that it destroyed the works upon which it was based.[^euclids-elements] Back then, books were expensive and required frequent copying by hand. Faced with a choice between copying Euclid's *Elements* or the books that it obsoleted, the ancients chose to copy Euclid instead of the previous works that were of historical interest only, historical interest that the ancients could not afford.

[^euclids-elements]: This is a cartoon sketch. The actual textual history of Euclid's *Elements* is studied only by historians of mathematics. Working mathematicians typically hold it at a respectful distance and actively try not to not get too close to it, since an accurate view of the history of mathematics is harmful to the actual practice of mathematics (I speak from personal experience), because the real history of mathematics is not a mathematical textbook written for its educational content. History of mathematics is useful only as a carefully sketched cartoon, omitting almost all the real details, and completely violating historical truth sometimes, because some truths are not adaptive.

To reproduce itself, continental philosophy must keep itself from being explained or clarified, especially by insiders. To educate new continental philosophers, the old continental philosophers would write simple explainers and summaries, like *The Edinburgh Dictionary of Continental Philosophy*. However, such reference books risk becoming substitutes for the original source material, starting a slippery slope into clarity. This prevents the old confusions from being cleared up. "textual deference", and "there is no substitute for reading the masters".[@smithTextualDeference1991]

To throw such textual deference into stark relief, consider how scientists treat their history. Working scientists have only the most cartoonish knowledge of the history of their fields. Classical papers are rarely read, except in fields so immature that they do not have good textbooks yet and the only way to proceed is reading the original papers. In fact, one can measure the maturity of a field by the ignorance of its practitioners about its original sources, and the lack of bibliography in textbooks. A textbook on electrodynamics does not refer to Coulomb or Maxwell's original books. A course in relativity does not attempt to explicate the original papers by Einstein. The original sources are typically fumbling and barely comprehensible, a target for improvement, then swiftly relegated to mere history.

The easiest method is to simply declare some sources as original and all else derivative, to freeze the great canonical works for all times. However, this is not sustainable, as new philosophers are not content to merely read the great canons, but want their own chance at joining the great canons. Thus we arrive at the tradition of "the Great Conversation" [@adlerGreatConversationRevisited1990, page 28]:

> What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about this idea or that, this topic or that. They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways.

With the Great Conversation, continental philosophy reproduces itself. The old master texts remain inscrutable. New inscrutable texts are added to the canon. New texts that are too clear or sensible are denounced as derivative, analytical, reductionistic, or perhaps kitsch, and denied entrance to the canon.
