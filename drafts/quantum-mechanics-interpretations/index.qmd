The essay is written at the level of two years of undergraduate mathematics. I will keep jargons to a minimum and use as few infinities as possible. For example, instead of particles that can be anywhere on a real-number line, I would talk about particles that can be in one of three boxes.

## Many-world theory

## Pilot wave theory

## Copenhagen interpretation

## Relational quantum mechanics

## QBism
