<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="translation">Translation</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One naturally wonders if the problem of translation could conceivably be treated as a problem in cryptography. When I look at an article in Russian, I say: “This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I will now proceed to decode.”</p>
<p>– Warren Weaver, Letter to Norbert Wiener, 1947-03-04</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During WWII, the science of communication and control took on a life-and-death importance. The mathematically perfect Enigma forced Allied mathematicians to turn their art of code into the science of information, so as to extract every last bit of information leaked out from the unknown enemy who was less than mathematically perfect, who made mistakes, who stuttered with verbal tics like <code>WETTER</code> or <code>KEINE BESONDEREN EREIGNISSE</code>. On two sides of the Atlantic, Alan Turing of computer science, and Claude Shannon of information theory, fought in this information warfare.</p>
<p>Before the war, some feared that the bombers would finally be the ultimate weapon, as a fleet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_bomber_will_always_get_through">them will always get through</a>. Bombing was becoming a cyborg activity. The bombers were flying so high and so fast, the bombardiers needed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norden_bombsight">intricate bombsights</a> filled with mechanical calculators, just to calculate the correct time to drop the bombs.</p>
<p>But the bombers would not go through after all, as radar screens and flak cannons raised invisible walls in the sky, and the anti-aircraft fire became another cyborg activity. Norbert Wiener developed his control theory in the context of anti-aircraft fire and radar screening. He thought of both as a form of deadly communication. A radar speaks to the aircraft, “Who and where are you?” Despite itself, the aircraft must answer. The radar’s job is to speak clearly with the right ping and listen carefully with the right filter. In this context, he developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter">Wiener filter</a>.</p>
<p>Anti-aircraft (AA) seems even less like a deadly communication, yet Wiener made it work. To shoot down an aircraft, one must predict where it will be a few seconds into the future, since that is how long bullets take to fly that high. The AA looks to the sky and asks, “Where are you going?”. Despite itself, the aircraft speaks with where it had been in the past few seconds, as if writing a cursive word in the sky. The AA reads and understands this writing, and act accordingly. The past is a code for the future, like the Enigma is a code for the plaintext. <span class="citation" data-cites="yeangFilteringNoiseAntiaircraft2023">(<a href="#ref-yeangFilteringNoiseAntiaircraft2023" role="doc-biblioref">Yeang 2023</a>)</span></p>
<p>If the soldiers are always preparing to fight the previous war, the same seems true for some mathematicians. Wiener and his collaborator, Warren Weaver, decided to tackle the problem of machine translation with the same tools they developed for war. If information theory helps with breaking the Enigma code, would it not also help with breaking the language codes?</p>

<p>During the 1950s, electronic computers were mainly understood and used as tools for real-valued calculations, such as simulating nuclear explosions, the aerodynamics of ballistic missiles, macroeconomic planning, and other important real-valued functions that are necessary to safeguard freedom. However, there was already early attempts at using computers for symbolic calculations.</p>
<p>In a sense, this was quite old. Whereas Charles Babbage designed his computer as an arithmetic mill to grind out numerical tables, Ada Lovelace speculated that computers can grind out symbolic music too, as long as music and its transformation rules are encoded into integers.</p>
<p>On 1954-01-07, the world’s first non-human translator appeared in the body of an IBM 701. At least, that is what the newspapers made it seam to be.</p>
<p>Back in 1952-06, at a MIT conference on machine translation (MT),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Leon Dostert was convinced that instead of arguments about whether MT works <em>in theory</em>, they needed to try it out on an actual problem to see if it would work <em>in practice</em>. This led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment">Georgetown–IBM experiment</a> 1.5 years later. It was the first public demonstration of machine translation – from Russian to English, and was widely reported with titles like “Electronic brain translates Russian” or “Robot brain translates Russian into King’s English”.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The acronym “MT” now stands for “machine translation”, but in the early days, it stood for “mechanical translation”.</p></div></div><p>To put some meat to the bones, consider the following hardware specs for the IBM 701 and the demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IBM 701 machine operated at <span class="math inline">\(2000 \;\mathrm{FLOP/s}\)</span></li>
<li>It performed read/write speed <span class="math inline">\(3.6 \;\mathrm{kB/s}\)</span> (in the form of 80-column punched cards).</li>
<li>The program took up <span class="math inline">\(2400 \;\mathrm{instruction} \times 18 \;\mathrm{bit/instruction} = 5.4 \;\mathrm{kB}\)</span></li>
<li>The dictionary took up <span class="math inline">\(6000 \;\mathrm{word} \times 36 \;\mathrm{bit/word} = 27 \;\mathrm{kB}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dictionary is a table with 6 columns: Russian, English equivalent I, English equivalent II, Code 1, Code 2, Code 3. As we see, each Russian word has 1 or 2 possible English translations. The three <code>Code</code>s are essentially grammar categories. As an example, the suffix <code>-a</code> is coded as <code>(-a, of, , 131, 222, 25)</code>, while the word stem <code>ugl-</code> is coded as <code>(ugl-, coal, angle, 121, ***, 25)</code>.</p>
<p>The dictionary contains just 250 lexical items (stems and endings). Its grammar has just 6 rules. All input sentences must be made of words that are of form either <code>stem</code> or <code>stem-ending</code>. Some example translations included:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mi pyeryedayem mislyi posryedstvom ryechyi.</p>
<p>We transmit thoughts by means of speech.</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption class="margin-caption">A punched card from the demo. The Russian sentence is encoded with the hole patterns and then read by the IBM 701. The output was not by punched cards, but by a printer.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The algorithm is essentially a word-substitution program, using the 6 rules to disambiguate, and to decide whether to switch a word with a previous word. The word-order switch is necessary since Russian puts prepositions as word suffixes. For example, <code>ugl-a</code> would be word-substituted to <code>angle-by</code>, but must be translated as <code>by angle</code>.</p>
<p>The experiment was a hit, and there were some predictions of imminent breakthrough <span class="citation" data-cites="hutchinsFirstPublicDemonstration2005">(<a href="#ref-hutchinsFirstPublicDemonstration2005" role="doc-biblioref">Hutchins 2005</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such a device should be ready within three to five years… As soon as cards for Russian are completed, sets will be made for German and French. Then other Slavic, Germanic and Romance languages can be set up at will.</li>
<li>100 rules would be needed to govern 20,000 words for free translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>From our perspective, these seem painfully optimistic. However, it was a common belief that electronic computers, like the IBM 701, were designed for numerical computation, something that is more difficult than natural language processing. As such, a machine translator needed not faster computers, but more data. Yet among the general optimism, there was a disquieting note:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the formulation of logic required to convert word meanings properly even in a small segment of two languages necessitates two and a half times as many instructions to the computer as are required to simulate the flight of a guided missile.</p>

<p>One thing I dislike about some technical histories and overviews is that I keep getting a cotton-like, vaporwave feeling in the brain after reading them. It is easy to read an abstract story.</p>
<p>For example, many AI papers by OpenAI after 2020 has become like that. In any case, I looked up the program, which appeared in <span class="citation" data-cites="ornsteinMechanicalTranslationNew1955">(<a href="#ref-ornsteinMechanicalTranslationNew1955" role="doc-biblioref">Ornstein 1955</a>)</span> as a single giant flowchart. I didn’t read the spaghetti code in detail, but it seems to me that it first parses the input sequence into words and sub-words, then it starts from left to right, for each word/sub-word, find the rule that applies to it. Executing the rule would pick an English translation for that word/sub-word, and either switch that fragment of translation with the previous fragment, or not. There are 6 rules, of which I just copy one, since the others look similarly boring:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Choice-Rearrangement. If first code is <code>131</code>, is third code of preceding complete word or either portion (root or ending) of preceding subdivided word equal to <code>23</code>? If so, adopt English equivalent II of word carrying <code>131</code> and retain order of appearance of words in output; if not, adopt English equivalent I and reverse order of appearance of words in output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is a rough Python sketch. It just implements half of rule 3, but gives you an idea of how the program would go. I estimate that it should take about 100 lines to implement a fully correct version. Even this rough sketch tells you that it is a very 1950s kind of program, with imperatives and if-then statements everywhere, combined with table lookups.</p>

<p>The exact details on how the program was implemented on the IBM was non-trivial, since both the machine and the programming environment around it were designed for numerical computations, not discrete symbolic manipulations. <span class="citation" data-cites="sheridanResearchLanguageTranslation1955">(<a href="#ref-sheridanResearchLanguageTranslation1955" role="doc-biblioref">Sheridan 1955</a>)</span> described the details. The programming language LISP must wait until 1960 to appear. Dedicated to symbolic manipulations. It would dominate most of AI research until the 1980s.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is the amount of restrictions placed on the demo: 250 words, each word having just 1 or 2 possible translations, and each Russian word is either a full word or a <code>stem-suffix</code>, etc. An even deeper restriction was entirely hidden from view: pronouns. In Russian, pronouns are often dropped when the verb form makes it clear. To avoid this problem, for all demonstrated sentences, the English pronouns occur only in translations of verbs in the third person plural.</p>

<p>The Georgetown–IBM demo worked. The CIA started funding MT research at Georgetown University (eventually up to $1,500,000), and other MT groups sprang up in America, Europe, and the Soviet Union. In general, their approaches could be divided into three parts: word-for-word, syntax, and eclectic.</p>
<p>The idea of word-for-word translation is essentially a direct scale-up of the Georgetown–IBM demo, just with a much bigger dictionary and a few more local word-reordering rules. True, there are some ambiguities like “The vodka was good, but the meat was rotten.”, but we can just pick the most likely translation, or translate a multi-word Russian phrase directly to a multi-word English phrase, etc. Erwin Reifler exemplified the “solved by lexicography” approach:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Papers on MT are nowadays heavily weighted on the side of the development of structural linguistic procedures for the solution of MT problems, and very rightly so. But many of these problems can be solved by lexicography… in certain types of cases of higher frequency it is possible to solve grammatical and non-grammatical problems by lexicography and lexicographical procedures alone–that is, without the necessity of logical procedures and logical machine operations. Since our sponsors had asked us to concentrate, at least during the initial phases of our project, on the elaboration of a bilingual lexicon, we decided to try to achieve an optimum of lexicography which would solve as many of our bilingual problems as possible. The results of this lexicographical work were… almost 170,000 MT-operational Russian-English entries.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="reiflerSolutionMTLinguistic1960">(<a href="#ref-reiflerSolutionMTLinguistic1960" role="doc-biblioref">Reifler 1960</a>)</span></p>

<p>This was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/GSQ-16_Automatic_Language_Translator">AN/GSQ-16 translator</a>, which would eventually be subsumed by SYSTRAN.</p>
<p>Similarly, at RAND corporation, they performed large-scale statistical analysis of corpus, used the analysis to write some Russian-English dictionary and reordering rules. Ran the program, checked the output, rewrote the dictionary and rules, etc. It was kind of a RAND-om gradient descent.</p>
<p>At MIT under Victor Yngve, the research agenda was fully based on syntax. A sentence in the source language is parsed into a syntax tree, then the syntax tree is transformed by some rotation, grafting, cutting, and pasting, and finally the leaf-words are substituted into the target language. To see an example use of this, consider the German sentence »Hans kommt heute abend an.«, which translates to “Hans arrives this evening”.. Here, “arrives” corresponds to »kommt … an«, and the distance between the two pieces of the verb can be arbitrarily long, thus no local transformation rule would work. However, though this is similar in spirit to Chomskyan linguistics, Chomsky was only briefly in the group, and his generative grammar was not used.</p>

<p>At Georgetown, the approach was more eclectic, with some syntax parsing and some statistical analysis with dictionary. Like most eclectic systems, it defies summary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Soviet Union, MT research was based on a deep analysis of language at multiple levels (phonetic, phonemic, morphemic, surface syntactic, deep syntactic, semantic), similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Vauquois#Vauquois_triangle">Vauquois triangle</a>, though they called it “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning%E2%80%93text_theory">Meaning–Text Theory</a>”.</p>

<p>Around 1964, there was an uneasy feeling around AI. The post-war flood of governmental funds was slowing as the optimistic “Science, the Endless Frontier” lost its shine. There were much bigger projects to do, like sending 2 men to the moon or 3 million to Vietnam. The general atmosphere was subdued. Eventually funding would be cut even more with the Mansfield Amendments of 1973, which limited ARPA to only funding projects directly relevant to military applications.</p>

<p>By 1966, it was estimated that roughly 20 million dollars (in contemporary dollars) had been spent on MT in the US, with Georgetown, at 1,317,239 dollars (93.5 percent from the CIA, 6.5 percent from the NSF) being the largest.. “In comparison, let us notice that in June 1952, when the First conference on Machine Translation convened at MIT, there was probably one person in the world engaged more than half-time in work on MT, namely myself [Bar-Hillel]”. The budget had been roughly ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>In 1964, the US government created the ALPAC committee of 7 linguists “to advise the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Science Foundation on research and development in the general field of mechanical translation of foreign languages”. The roster of names makes it clear that MT was a matter of state security. It was all well and good if MT could eventually reach human level performance in a few centuries, or if MT research could <em>right now</em> inform the science of linguistics and assist the universe’s ceaseless striving to rationally know itself, but let us never confuse the universal with the here and now.</p>

<p>The Georgetown–IBM experiment proved to be <em>too</em> good of a demo. The sentences were picked to present it in the best light, and the rules were written so that the machine would translate the sentences correctly. Subsequent MT research could not match the demo, and skeptics appeared.</p>

<p>Dorset is “a great conversationalist … but as a researcher I was unsure about him, whether he was just a figurehead or whether he was a bit of a fraud – the Georgetown MT demonstrations seemed always to be contrived; they made impressive publicity for the sponsors, but they soured the atmosphere by raising expectations that nobody could possibly fulfill.” … MT colleague Winifred Lehmann was overheard describing him as “a wart on the field of linguistics”.</p>

<p>The ALPAC committee worked for 2 more years before presenting the final report in 1966 <span class="citation" data-cites="automaticlanguageprocessingadvisorycommitteeLanguageMachinesComputers1966">(<a href="#ref-automaticlanguageprocessingadvisorycommitteeLanguageMachinesComputers1966" role="doc-biblioref">Committee et al. 1966</a>)</span>. Most of the report is not on whether MT is possible, but on the economics of translating technical documents from Russian to English, and whether MT would be economically good enough for this within the next few years. For example, it calculated that since a machine-translated document takes longer to read, if a document were to be read by more than 20 people, human translation is more economical. What the report says about MT itself is fairly brief:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Machine Translation” presumably means going by algorithm from machine-readable source text to useful target text, without recourse to human translation or editing. In this context, there has been no machine translation of general scientific text, and none is in immediate prospect. The contention that there has been no machine translation of general scientific text is supported by the fact that when, after 8 years of work, the Georgetown University MT project tried to produce useful output in 1962, they had to resort to postediting. The postedited translation took slightly longer to do and was more expensive than conventional human translation.</p>
<p>… Early machine translations of simple or selected text, such as those given above, were as deceptively encouraging as “machine translations” of general scientific text have been uniformly discouraging. However, work toward machine translation has produced much valuable linguistic knowledge and insight that we would not otherwise have attained.</p>
<p>… it is wise to press forward undaunted, in the name of science, but that the motive for doing so cannot sensibly be any foreseeable improvement in practical translation. Perhaps our attitude might be different if there were some pressing need for machine translation, but we find none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this, it resulted in a swift deep cut in governmental funding for MT research, not just in America, but also in the Soviet Union. Quite understandable. However, like the concurrent loss of funding for neural network research, it resulted in an AI winter for MT, and a general impression that MT had been debunked.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Its effect was to bring to an end the substantial funding of MT research in the United States for some twenty years. More significantly, perhaps, was the clear message to the general public and the rest of the scientific community that MT was hopeless. For years afterwards, an interest in MT was something to keep quiet about; it was almost shameful. To this day, the ‘failure’ of MT is still repeated by many as an indisputable fact… from time to time in the next decades researchers would discuss among themselves whether “another ALPAC” might not be inflicted upon MT.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehoshua_Bar-Hillel">Yehoshua Bar-Hillel</a> against machine translation – what he called FAHQT (Fully Automatic High-Quality Translation, or as I imagine him saying it, “Machine translation? Ah, FAHQT.”). The argument goes like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>FAHQT requires general world understanding, because natural language is full of ambiguities that require general wordl understanding.</li>
<li>General world understanding is “utterly chimerical and hardly deserves any further discussion’.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard example he gave was “The box is in the pen.”, where the issue is how to disambiguate the word “pen”. Does it mean the writing instrument, or an enclosure? For a machine to pick the right meaning, it must know that a pen cannot contain a box, while an enclosure can. This cannot be done by merely looking up every word in a dictionary, or drawing up its the syntax tree. It must have general world understanding, or common sense.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Assume, for simplicity’s sake, that <em>pen</em> in English has only the following two meanings: (1) a certain writing utensil, (2) an enclosure where small children can play. I now claim that no existing or imaginable program will enable an electronic computer to determine that the word <em>pen</em> in the given sentence within the given context has the second of the above meanings, whereas every reader with a sufficient knowledge of English will do this “automatically”.</p>
<p>Whenever I offered [the challenge] to one of my colleagues working on MT, their first reaction was: “But why not envisage a system which will put this knowledge at the disposal of the translation machine?” … What such a suggestion amounts to, if taken seriously, is the requirement that a translation machine should not only be supplied with a dictionary but also with a universal encyclopedia. This is surely utterly chimerical and hardly deserves any further discussion… Reasonable goals are then either fully automatic, low quality translation or partly automatic, high quality translation. Both are theoretically feasible and, for certain language pairs, attainable today though not yet on a commercial scale.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="bar-hillelPresentStatusAutomatic1960">(<a href="#ref-bar-hillelPresentStatusAutomatic1960" role="doc-biblioref">Bar-Hillel 1960</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If FAQHT is impossible for all “existing or imaginable” programs, there can exist only two proper kinds of machine translation. One was automatic low-quality translation, and another was explicitly designed as a help, not a replacement, to human translators. The first kind was all there was, and Bar-Hillel called for researchers to work on the second kind.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has mentioned “learning machines” only to not discuss it further, even though machine learning would turn out to be the key to general world understanding. This dismissal of machine learning would continue for quite some more years.</p>
<p>He presented his opinion more forcefully 4 years later in an editorial:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It seems now quite certain to some of us, a small but apparently growing minority, that with all the progress made in hardware (i.e., apparatus), programming techniques and linguistic insight, the quality of fully autonomous mechanical translation, even when restricted to scientific or technological material, will never approach that of qualified human translators and that therefore Machine Translation will only under very exceptional circumstances be able to compete with human translation.</p>
<p>… there is no prospect whatsoever that the employment of electronic digital computers in the field of translation will lead to any revolutionary changes. A complete automation of the activity is wholly utopian, since the fact that books and papers are usually written for readers with a certain background knowledge and an ability for logical deduction and plausible reasoning cannot be over-ridden by even the cleverest utilization of all formal features of a discourse. The hopes to the contrary which many of us had a decade ago just turned out to be by and large unrealizable. The quicker this is understood, the better are the chances that more attention will be paid to finding efficient ways of improving the status of scientific and technological translation–I am not qualified to discuss literary translation–including a judicious and modest use of <em>mechanical aids</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bar-Hillel’s objection is reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_schema_challenge">Winograd schema challenge</a>, which also tests for general world understanding. Indeed, even Terry Winograd had a tentative guess that the Winograd challenge is too challenging, though it is clearly just a weak guess, not a firm prediction like the previous quotes.</p>

<p>The limitations on the formalization of contextual meaning make it impossible at present – and conceivably forever – to design computer programs that come close to full mimicry of human language understanding.</p>

<p>What do we make of such criticism? At that point in time, there were three possible replies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Intelligence amplification: Instead of the mirage of replacing human translators, try to build little programs that augment human translators.</li>
<li>Brute force logical programming: Scale up commonsense by hiring more linguists to program in increasingly large chunks of the world.</li>
<li>AI is a mirage, and the failures of MT is a symptom of that.</li>
</ol>
<p>From our vantage point, the actual solution turned out to be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The bitter lesson: Wait a few decades, then train a giant neural network on a trillion words from the Internet to give it general world knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a common mistake about the bitter lesson, that even Richard Sutton makes. It is not just that the bitter lesson is bitter, but also that it is <em>difficult</em>. People did not believe in it, not because they were afraid of bitterness, but because it was obviously stupid, a kind of straw man’s argument.</p>
<p>Consider the arguments of a latter-day Bar-Hillel:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The case against machine translation as a solution to practical problems is overwhelming and has been made many times. I do not propose to repeat it in any detail here. It will, however, be worth a few words to make a <em>prima facie</em> case for the implausibility of practical machine translation if only so that the contrast with realistic approaches to the problem will be more striking… There is a great deal that computer scientists and linguists could contribute to the practical problem of producing translations, but, in their own interests as well as those of their customers, they should <strong>never</strong> be asked to provide an engineering solution to a problem that they only dimly understand.</p>
<p>I want to advocate a view of the problem in which machines are gradually, almost imperceptibly, allowed to take over certain functions in the overall translation process. First they will take over functions not essentially related to translation. Then, little by little, they will approach translation itself. The keynote will be <em>modesty</em>. At each stage, we will do only what we know we can do reliably.</p>

<p>Now we know that “engineering solutions to a problem they only dimly understand” was precisely the breakthrough in multiple fields. In this essay we would this appearing in <a href="#sec-speech">speech recognition</a>, TODO, TODO, and TODO. It also happened with AlphaGo, made by a team who only had Go amateurs, or diffusion artists made by engineers with minimal understanding of art. However, just try saying out loud, “I’ll solve translation just by training a sequence to sequence neural network, on a few million pairs of English-German sentence pairs. It won’t have a probabilistic interpretation, or a syntax tree, or morphological constraints. In fact I haven’t even taken a course in intermediate linguistics. But I have trained many neural networks. Surely if I can get the loss low enough, it will work.” The reasonable reply would be, “What hubris, to tackle a problem that has stumped decades of linguistic science with the brute reason of engineering! What Goodhart law, to expect minimizing loss will lead to the thing you actually want, which is translation? What alchemy, to expect to put in nothing but data and compute, and somehow create understanding in a machine, an understanding that you don’t have yourself?”.[^feynman-kac]</p>
<p>[^feynman-kac] Perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman%E2%80%93Kac_formula">Feynman–Kac</a> anecdote illustrates this better.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Kac went to Pasadena to lecture at the California Institute of Technology. Richard Feynman was in the audience. After the lecture, Feynman got up and announced: "If all mathematics disappeared, it would set physics back precisely one week." Without a pause, Kac responded: "Precisely the week in which God created the world."

So perhaps...

&gt; "If we fired all the linguists, it would set machine translation back precisely one week."
&gt; 
&gt; "Precisely the week in which God struck down the Tower of Babel."</code></pre>
<p>To end this section, I quote from one of the authors of the ALPAC report an amusing anecdote about Yngve, which was an omen of the ultimate fate of logical MT:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There’s sometimes a strong scholastic emphasis, or current, which causes some psychologists to produce very closely reasoned ideas that aren’t checked at every point with experiment. Some of the theoretical linguists are like that. They are extremely plausible. But I know a fellow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Yngve">Victor Yngve</a>, who tried to write a transformational grammar of the English language, a reasonably complete one. It took him years and years and he never got it written.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-alignment-problem">The alignment problem</h3>
<p>The decade after ALPAC was more subdued. MT research continued, but with minimal government funding, and it often continued as a kind of computational study in service of basic research in linguistics. They typically followed the approach of Vauquois, that is, to take a sentence from one language, and parse it into higher and higher levels of abstraction, reaching an “interlingua” stage that is fully language-independent, then move back down again until one lands safely in the other language. It reminds me of taking an airplane across an ocean.</p>
<p>But MT was about to take a sudden turn away from theory.</p>
<p>In 1986, speech recognition was solved. Well, not exactly, but during the period of 1976–1986, a group of researchers in IBM managed to produce speech recognition systems better than ever before, by “firing the linguists”, and returning to the information-theoretic approach that Shannon and Weaver had back in the 1950s. Armed with compute, data, and a disregard for linguistic science, they got it to work, and in 1986, they decided to try the same trick, but this time with MT.</p>
<p>In our language, the idea was encoder-decoder translation, using Bayesian probability. Suppose we want to translate a sentence in foreign language <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to an English sentence <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. We imagine that the foreign speaker was really trying to speak English, but somehow, words came out <em>encoded</em> as a foreign language, and our goal is to <em>decode</em> from it. This gives us 3 components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>English language model: <span class="math inline">\(Pr(e)\)</span>, the prior probability of the speaker wanting to say <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</li>
<li>Encoder model: <span class="math inline">\(Pr(f | e)\)</span>, the conditional probability that the speaker would end up saying <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, if they wanted to say <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</li>
<li>Decoder: <span class="math inline">\(f \mapsto e\)</span>, the translator we want to construct.</li>
</ol>
<p>The decoder is the maximum a posteriori solution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
e^*(f) := \mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}_e Pr(f|e) Pr(e)
\]</span></p>

</div>
<p>Once we have both <span class="math inline">\(Pr(f|e)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Pr(e)\)</span>, we have a machine translator. To obtain <span class="math inline">\(Pr(f|e)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Pr(e)\)</span>, the team used simple statistical models, not much more complex than n-gram models, with parameters estimated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm">expectation-maximization algorithm</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;We are skipping over the word-alignment part of the IBM models, which tells you which words in <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> corresponds to which words in <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. We still have an encoder-decoder architecture, but it’s more complicated.</p></div></div><p>The IBM team worked on this from 1986 to the early 1990s, and their state of the art performance led to a statistical revolution in MT. Compared to the theoretically principled MT of the past, the IBM language model was obviously wrong: languages are obviously impossible to be correctly modelled by an n-gram model, or the slightly more complex upgraded models they used. Where are the syntax trees, the constituencies, etc? Yet it did work, and it took over practical MT research.</p>
<p>Their primary dataset was the Canadian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard">Hansard</a> corpus – transcripts of proceedings from the Canadian parliament which were available in both English and French due to Canada’s bilingual policy. The Hansard parallel corpus contained around 3 million sentence pairs at the time. While substantial, it pales in comparison to monolingual English corpora to train <span class="math inline">\(Pr(e)\)</span>. English text was abundant from government documents, news archives, books, etc. In short, the encoder-decoder structure was adapted for the data regime of abundant monolingual (used to train <span class="math inline">\(Pr(e)\)</span>) but limited parallel text (used to train <span class="math inline">\(Pr(f|e)\)</span>).</p>
<p>In the introduction to a “Special Issue on Computational Linguistics Using Large Corpora”, <span class="citation" data-cites="churchIntroductionSpecialIssue1993">(<a href="#ref-churchIntroductionSpecialIssue1993" role="doc-biblioref">K. W. Church and Mercer 1993</a>)</span> argued that “Rationalism”, having been reigning since 1970s, was facing legitimate challenge by “Empiricism” again, for three reasons: more compute, more data, and a culture centered on evaluation.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The emphasis today on empirical methods in the speech recognition community is a reaction to the failure of knowledge-based approaches of the 1970s. It has become popular once again to focus on high-level natural language constraints in order to reduce the search space. But this time, n-gram methods have become the methods of choice because they seem to work better than the alternatives, at least when the search space is measured in terms of entropy. Ideally, we might hope that someday parsers might reduce entropy beyond that of n-grams, but right now, parsers seem to be more useful for other tasks such as understanding who did what to whom, and less useful for predicting what the speaker is likely to say.</p>
<p>Someday parsers might help squeeze out some of this remaining half bit between the trigram model and Shannon’s bound, but thus far, parsing has had little impact… The issue remains as controversial as ever, as evidenced by the lively debate on rationalism versus empiricism at TMI-92, a recent conference on MT… The information theoretic approach to MT may fail for reasons advanced by Chomsky and others in the 1950s. But regardless of its ultimate success or failure, there is a growing community of researchers in corpus-based linguistics who believe that it will produce a number of lexical resources that may be of great value.</p>

<p>That was 1993. And the Internet was coming, and it kept coming, and it is still coming, and it just won’t stop coming.</p>
<p>When a user makes a search request like “IBM”, Google’s servers must retrieve not only website urls like <code>www.ibm.com</code>, but also a snippet view like “…<strong>IBM</strong> has been a global technology innovator…”. Therefore, Google had been crawling the Internet and storing a plain-text copy of the Internet regularly, with a size on the order of 100 TB as of 2003. <span class="citation" data-cites="barrosoWebSearchPlanet2003">(<a href="#ref-barrosoWebSearchPlanet2003" role="doc-biblioref">Barroso, Dean, and Holzle 2003</a>)</span> Once with such a large dataset, what could be done with it?</p>
<p>In 2006, Google Translate was launched. Early reactions were a mixture of fascination and sarcasm, leading to memes of hilarious Google translations that has survived to this day, even though the improvements has made it very difficult to do nowadays. Despite this, it was agreed that Google had achieved state of the art in statistical machine translation. How did it do it? By brutally scaling up.</p>

The largest model was trained on a dump of the Internet (January 2006) with 2 trillion tokens, 300M 5-grams, 16M vocab, 1.8 TB language model, took 1 day to train on 1500 machines.

While trigrams cannot capture everything, they often work better than the alternatives… That argument made a lot of sense in the 1990s, especially given unrealistic expectations that had been raised during the previous [expert systems] boom.

<p>It has been 15 years. The pendulum is still probing the unknown depths of Empiricism.</p>
<p>In 1989, ABBYY was founded in Moscow. Its first product was an electronic dictionary, followed by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBYY_FineReader">ABBYY FineReader optical character recognition (OCR)</a>, which became an international hit. With such a stable cash flow, ABBYY aimed higher: It would develop Compreno, a “Natural Language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">Compiler</a>” (NLC) based on linguistic theory. Compreno would take the lowest level of Vauquois triangle (actual language) to the highest level (language-independent meaning, interlingua), which can then be decompiled to another language. It was Meaning–Text Theory in action.</p>
<p>The founders of ABBYY were students of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology">Moscow PhysTech</a>, and ABBYY already had hired linguists to work on its dictionaries and OCR, so it seemed only natural to implement the natural language compiler based on the science of linguistics.</p>

<p>Along with the programmers and machine learning specialists who held profitable products like FineReader and FlexiCapture (a smart, customizable payment recognition system for banks) on their shoulders, this cozy office houses dozens, and at its peak, hundreds of linguists.

<p>We had customers who needed, for example, to extract data on transaction participants from document scans in which the text was written in a kind of “legal dialect” of American English. When this text (with recognition errors, extra dots due to breadcrumbs on the scan and other artifacts) flew into the sophisticated NLC / Compreno analyzer, the output was most often an absolutely unpredictable mess with a bunch of messages about parsing errors… The variety of syntactic-semantic structures was almost greater than the (comparatively more predictable) variety of simple word chains of the source text. At some point, I realized that most of the time I was engaged in a war with Compreno output using regular expressions and other crutches, and I thought that I needed to leave ABBYY.</p>
<p>After leaving the company, I once took HSE computer linguistics students on a tour of ABBYY… One of the students, Pasha, joked that ABBYY employees climb up there during a thunderstorm and shout “I’m making a correct parser in 2018,” after which lightning strikes them. It was a cruel joke, but it hit the mark.</p>

<p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is the conversion of speech audio to text. Its history resembles the history of MT.</p>
<p>It is hard to know what is closest at hand. Speaking is so natural that it takes effort to even notice that there is structure within the smallest sound, and it required the invention of the phonograph to notice the fine details of even a single vowel. In the early 20th century, as AT&amp;T connected all of America with telephone lines, it funded research into efficient coding of speech, with the hopeful goal of saving on bandwidth. The rough idea is similar to the idea of mp3: If the engineers knew what mattered and what didn’t matter in human speech recognition, then they could squeeze more telephone calls within the same line.</p>
<p>Concretely, one could imagine a device on a telephone that converts all the richness of a speech-stream into just 20 bit-streams, then braid those 20 bit-streams into a narrow frequency band, send it all the way across America, whereupon it gets decompressed back to the speech-stream, impoverished but still perfectly recognizable.</p>
<p>It began with recognition of individual spoken words, which was possible by featurizing the sound, then match that sequence of feature vectors against the template feature vectors.</p>
<p>An illustrative example of this early period of ASR was reported in <span class="citation" data-cites="denesDesignOperationMechanical1959">(<a href="#ref-denesDesignOperationMechanical1959" role="doc-biblioref">Denes 1959</a>)</span>. It could spell individual word phonetically (i.e.&nbsp;“cartoon” spelled as “katun”) – if the word is made out of only 4 vowels and 9 consonants, in an alternating fashion (i.e.&nbsp;no two vowels together, or two consonants together).</p>
<p>The machine first uses a filter bank to featurize the input sound. Pairs of outputs from the filter bank are then multiplied to measure how likely the sound is a phoneme. For example, the outputs from 200 Hz and 320 Hz are multiplied together, and that measures how likely the sound is “m”, because the two principal frequencies of “m” are close to 200 Hz and 320 Hz. Finally, a computer selects the most likely phoneme, based on the multiplied results and a simple statistical model of how likely a phoneme is to follow the previous phoneme.</p>

<p>In typical generative grammar of language, you start with a <code>SENTENCE</code>, and repeatedly rewrite it until you end up with a sentence like <code>Did you hit Tom?</code></p>
<p>Here, we push this one level deeper. After a sentence is generated, you substitute each word with its standard pronunciation, resulting in a sequence like <code>dɪd/juː/hɪt/tɒm</code>. Next, apply more rewriting rules to account for the fact that we don’t pronounce a whole sentence like individual words, but always “glide two words together”. For example, <code>did you</code> would actually be pronounced like <code>dija</code>, so we account for this with a rewriting rule <code>d/juː -&gt; jə</code>. Similarly, the double <code>t</code> in <code>hit Tom</code> would be merged to a single <code>t</code>, so we add a rewriting rule <code>t/t -&gt; t</code>. And there is no gliding at <code>ə/h</code>, so we add <code>əh -&gt; əh</code>.</p>
<p>After this transformation, we obtain <code>dɪjəhɪtɒm</code></p>
<p>This is the basic idea of text-to-speech via generative grammar. For speech-to-text, one would first convert the speech audio into a sequence of phonemes,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> then reverse the generative grammar in the same way as one uses generative grammar to parse the syntax tree of a sentence.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Sometimes you see people distinguish “phone” from “phoneme”. In those cases, they make a finer distinction between what the speaker <em>intends to say</em> vs what actually comes out of their mouth. In this example, the phoneme would be <code>...</code> while the phone would be <code>...</code>. This precision is too annoying to me, so instead I will just say that the “phone” is just another “phoneme”, and the speaker intends to say the phoneme sequence <code>...</code>, which the speaking cortex in the brain encodes into the phoneme sequence <code>...</code> to save work for the throat muscles.</p></div></div><p>Unlike other aspects of natural language processing, speech-to-text had never abandoned statistics. Even the most ardent logical AI researcher admit that speech is filled with dirty random noise, and so must be processed by statistical filtering before it is clean enough to run symbolic programs over.</p>
<p>There were many logical ASR systems tried, but most of them consisted of 3 layers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Filter and segment speech into phone-like units, usually in steps of 10 milliseconds (because vowel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant">formants</a> are on the order of 100 Hz).</li>
<li>Use pattern recognition to identify the segments</li>
<li>Find the utterance that best fits the identified segment string.</li>
</ol>
<p>Roughly speaking, “the fit” is usually measured by how many rules are broken, with the rules written by expert linguists. Some examples would make the structure clear.</p>

<p>Like MT, there was also plenty of funding for ASR from the government. And we have not seen the last of John Pierce! 5 years after the ALPAC report debunked MT, he took aim at ASR with mostly the same arguments, but with even sharper language.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>speech recognition is attractive to money. The attraction is perhaps similar to the attraction of schemes for turning water into gasoline, extracting gold from the sea, curing cancer, or going to the moon… It is clear that glamor and any deceit in the field of speech recognition blind the takers of funds as much as they blind the givers of funds. Thus, we may pity workers whom we cannot respect. People who work in the field are full of innocent (in their own view) enthusiasm. What particular considerations have led to this enthusiasm?</p>
<p>… Most recognizers behave, not like scientists, but like mad inventors or untrustworthy engineers. The typical recognizer gets it into his head that he can solve “the problem.” The basis for this is either individual inspiration (the “mad inventor” source of knowledge) or acceptance of untested rules, schemes, or information (the untrustworthy engineer approach).</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="pierceWhitherSpeechRecognition1969">(<a href="#ref-pierceWhitherSpeechRecognition1969" role="doc-biblioref">Pierce 1969</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pierce gave the same answer as he gave in the ALPAC report. True ASR is impossible until a machine has a general understanding of language, which was very far away. What <em>appears</em> to be ASR is actually “artful deceit” made by mere engineering, not science. A true science of ASR is possible, by having a good scientific theory, then testing it, perhaps by building a device according to the theory, and see if it works as predicted.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The typical recognizer will have none of this. He builds or programs an elaborate system that either does very little or flops in an obscure way. A lot of money and time are spent. No simple, clear, sure knowledge is gained. The work has been an experience, not an experiment.</p>

<p>I don’t know what caused Pierce to fire off this fiery missive 3 years after the ALPAC report, but it did cause funding to decrease. <span class="citation" data-cites="jelinekMyBestFriends2005">(<a href="#ref-jelinekMyBestFriends2005" role="doc-biblioref">Jelinek 2005</a>)</span> Partly in reaction to this, ARPA started the Speech Understanding Project, a $15 million project to produce ASR, from 1971 to 1976. It funded 4 teams in 4 organizations, with the following goal: Demo a system that can do ASR on a fragment of English limited to 1000 words of vocabulary, and a single tiny domain. Accept new speakers after finetuning. At &lt;10% semantic error, at 100 MIPSS (100 million instructions per second of speech).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Out of the 4 teams, only Harpy achieved the target – barely. It could recognize 1011 words, at 5% semantic error. It has size 1.2 MB. It costs 30 MIP to process one second of speech, and since it ran on a 0.4 MIPS PDP-KAI0, it takes about 5 minutes to process a single 4-second sentence, costing about $5 to process one sentence. Fine-tuning for a single speaker takes about 30 minutes, or $30.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>As of 2024, the SOTA ASR model is OpenAI Whisper, which OpenAI offers at a price of <span class="math inline">\(\$10^{-4}\)</span> per second. Since $1 can buy you 1 hour of AI00 at <span class="math inline">\(10^{20} \;\mathrm{FLOP/hour}\)</span>, and assuming hardware utilization 10%, we have about <span class="math inline">\(10^{15} \;\mathrm{FLOP}\)</span> to process 1 second of speech.</p>
<p>I took a double take on this. Are we really throwing 1 million times more compute on ASR compared to Harpy?

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In 1971, when the program started, perhaps the majority of informed technical opinion put general speech recognition by computers as not possible in the foreseeable future and perhaps not possible at all… Informed technical opinion can now be that general cost-effective speech input to computers is an attainable goal.

<p>Harpy had the simplest architecture, with just two parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower divides the input audio into 10 ms segments. Each segment is featurized to a single <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{14}\)</span> vector by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_predictive_coding">Linear Predictive Coding</a>. If two segments have similar features, they are merged.</li>
<li>The upper part is a 15000-state transition graph. Each graph node is an annotated sound symbol. There are 98 sound symbols like <code>G BURST 1</code> or <code>IY</code>. The annotations allow the system to convert any path through the graph into a text sentence, like “Give me a textbook by Gauss.”.</li>
</ul>
<p>They first designed a complete context-free grammar that incorporates phonetics, syntax, and semantics for making document retrieval requests in a highly simplified and stilted syntax. The 98 sound symbols were constructed by “careful analysis of 747 sentences”. After the design was complete, the grammar was automatically compiled into the 15000-state transition graph.</p>
<p>To perform speech recognition, the lower part gives the upper part the featurized sequence of the audio <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\)</span>, and the upper part beam-searches for a path <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\)</span> that approximately minimizes <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i \| v_i - v(x_n)\|\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(v(x_i)\)</span> is the template feature vector for the sound <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>To finetune the system for a new speaker, the new speaker simply speaks 20 sentences designed for finetuning, and the system would recalculate the 98 template feature vectors.</p>

<p>Significantly, despite using a beam search, Harpy did <em>not</em> use a probabilistic model of language. It essentially treats language as Chomsky-nonrandom, and all the randomness comes from imperfect matching between the real feature vectors and the template feature vectors. Despite this, it out-performed other systems that did. It seems that the problem was that there was insufficient data to estimate the probabilities in a probabilistic language model.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Several of the speech understanding systems used estimates of the probability of a phonetic or lexical decision given the acoustic data in scoring the goodness of a theory, and each seems to have gotten into trouble by so doing. The problem is to analyze enough data to be sure of the probability of infrequent confusions. This is nearly impossible if one wants to take into consideration factors such as phonetic environment.</p>

<p>Just as significant, there was a lot of artificial intelligence, but very little machine learning. All the formal grammars were hand-written. It is revealing that in a comprehensive review of ASR <span class="citation" data-cites="reddySpeechRecognitionMachine1976">(<a href="#ref-reddySpeechRecognitionMachine1976" role="doc-biblioref">D. R. Reddy 1976</a>)</span>, “knowledge acquisition” took up less than 2% of the whole paper. And what little it said comes down to that learning-based methods require a large dataset of carefully and densely annotated audio, which was expensive and did not exist.</p>
<p>The last great attempt at logical ASR was the Hearsay-II, a further development from Hearsay, an unsuccessful entrant to the ARPA Speech Understanding Project. It was a towering giant with 7 levels, from “data base interface” and “phrase” all the way down to the “segment” and “parameter” and 15 knowledge sources (collection of rules) for going up and down the levels of abstraction. To handle this pandemonium of knowledge sources, it uses a “shared blackboard” architecture, so that each source can chime in about whatever is currently being interpreted. This allowed it to still work even if some sources are removed, and to improve whenever any source gets added or upgraded.</p>
<p>On one hand, it is great for interpretability, as one can trace through the entire structure and see exactly how any spoken sentence is parsed into a textual sentence. On the other hand, the interpretation took 39 steps and looks like:</p>

<p>Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of our speech recognition system goes up.</p>
<p>— Frederick Jelinek (1988) (not apocryphal!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jelinek">Frederick Jelinek</a> would go down in history as the one who fired linguists, but he did not start his life this way. In 1961, he sat in Chomsky’s lectures, and “got the crazy notion that I should switch from Information Theory to Linguistics”. His PhD advisor forbade him, so he remained in information theory. After graduation, he tried collaborating with the eminent linguist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Hockett">Charles Hockett</a>, bu Hockett then turned to composing operas. “Discouraged a second time, I devoted the next 10 years to Information Theory.” <span class="citation" data-cites="jelinekDawnStatisticalASR2009">(<a href="#ref-jelinekDawnStatisticalASR2009" role="doc-biblioref">Jelinek 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p>In 1972, he left academia and joined IBM, where he worked on ASR. The project started with two linguists, but they got frustrated and left of their own accord, leaving behind engineers and physicists with little understanding of linguistics.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;More details about this funny episode:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When handling natural speech, the main question was how to estimate the language model <span class="math inline">\(Pr(W)\)</span>. There was no simple way of achieving this. We thought that the right approach ought to be somehow related to English grammar. The linguist Stan Petrick, while he still was with us, said “Don’t worry, I will just make a little grammar.” Of course he never did, and the phrase acquired a mythical status in the manner of “famous last words.”</p>

</div></div><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When our Continuous Speech Recognition group started its work at IBM Research, the management wanted to make sure that our endeavors were guided by strict scientific principle. They therefore placed into the group two linguists who were going to guide our progress. Both linguists were quite self-confident, sure that fast progress will be possible. For instance, when we (trained as engineers or physicists) were at a loss how to construct a language model, one of the linguists declared “I’ll just write a little grammar.”… After about a year of frustration the linguists left our group, returned to their basic research, and we were free to pursue our self-organized, data driven, statistical dream… mostly of engineers and physicists. Only 3 or 4 people out of 10 had any previous experience with speech. None had graduate training in that field. But several of us had a background in Information Theory and that influenced our thinking.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It was unclear what exactly frustrated the linguists, but probably it was because they did not want, or did not have, the stamina to produce generative grammar for non-toy English:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the 1970s NLP and ASR research was dominated by an artificial intelligence approach. Programs were rule-based, expert systems were beginning to take over… The purest linguists based their work on self-constructed examples, not on the prevalence of phenomena in observed data. As already mentioned, strict distinction between training and test was frequently ignored. Grammars were being written that applied to less than dozen verbs.</p>

<p>This dedication to toys rather than would appear again later in the saga of SHRDLU.</p>
<p>The group naturally reproduced the information-theoretic framework for MT proposed by Shannon and Weaver, and adapted it directly to ASR.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In the framework, there are 4 components:</p>

<p>Step 3 is “feature engineering”, and it has been fairly static in speech processing: apply some high-pass filter, compute the spectrogram, do some more filtering, etc. Step 4 is maximum a posteriori estimation, exactly the same as in the IBM alignment model:<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Not a coincidence. The IBM team did ASR first, and once that succeeded, proceeded to trying the same trick with MT in 1986.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>we embarked on MT in 1986 when we sought a new area to which to apply our statistical, self organized techniques. Besides, we had 15 years of ASR work behind us and those who switched were also attracted by the change as well as the possibility of picking some “low hanging fruit”. We had two ideas: to use the noisy channel paradigm to formulate the problem (see Figure 3), and to base our learning on parallel texts. <span class="citation" data-cites="jelinekMyBestFriends2005">(<a href="#ref-jelinekMyBestFriends2005" role="doc-biblioref">Jelinek 2005</a>)</span></p>

<p>TODO Write about how this forced them to think about a different way to measure success. If they gave up the idea of either-or, then how does one tell if the program was improving? Inspired by Harpy, they decided to measure the branching factor … then perplexity.</p>
<p>It was of course possible, and even obvious, that one can combine the best of both worlds, to combine both linguistic insights and statistical methods, such as a probabilistic CFG.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The front end of the Raleigh system converted the speech signal… into a sequence of phoneme-like labels (100 labels per second), using an elaborate set of hand-tuned rules that would soon be replaced with an automatically trained procedure. The back end converted these labels into a sequence of words using an artificial finite-state grammar that was so small that the finite-state machine could be written down on a single piece of paper… very often phones were simply mislabeled. The back end was designed to overcome these problems by navigating through the finite-state network, applying a complicated set of hand-tuned penalties and bonuses to the various paths in order to favor those paths where the low-level acoustics matched the high-level grammatical constraints.</p>

<p>They soon produced an ASR model that achieved perfect accuracy on this, so they had to go bigger. The next dataset they obtained was the “laser patent corpus”, consisting of 2 million words of patent applications in laser technology, with a vocabulary size of 10,000, twice as large as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus">Brown Corpus (1961)</a>. They used this to train a 3-gram language model. The road to this dataset was quite circuitous, which anyone who has tried making a non-toy dataset can relate:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The struggle to compile a suitable training corpus featured throughout the CSR [Continuous Speech Recognition] group’s first decade. The researchers first considered using a collection of digitized IBM manuals, but found the vocabulary to be too extensive as well as so technical that it proved “difficult to pass … off as English.” They attempted to produce their own corpus, enlisting the wife of a lab staff member to type approximately a million words of text from children’s novels, but there, too, the vocabulary proved too large for their purposes. Next, the group acquired a collection of laser patent text from the US Patent Office, which was both sufficiently extensive in size and sufficiently narrow in vocabulary that they were finally able to extract a million words of running text confined to a thousand-word vocabulary. Though the laser patent corpus was considered “naturally occurring,” it was in fact meticulously constructed, even before researchers discarded all sentences containing vocabulary outside of the thousand most frequently occurring words. The complete patent text had to be first “subjected to intensive hand and computerized editing”: eliminating duplicates, merging spelling variations, and substituting scientific symbols and formulas. The claims sections of the patents proved especially problematic due to “highly stylized” legal language, and were ultimately excised entirely.</p>
<p>By the 1980s hardware improvements allowed the IBM researchers to expand their recognition vocabulary to five thousand words. They also compiled over 100 million words of data from a variety of sources, including public domain books and magazines from the American Printing House for the Blind, the records of the Amoco oil corporation, and 2.5 million words of office correspondence supplied by physicist Richard Garwin, who, with the aid of four secretaries, maintained computer-formatted duplicates of all of his correspondence. The most substantial collection in this period, however, came as a direct result of IBM’s unique industry dominance: the landmark federal antitrust lawsuit filed against the company in 1969. The case, which spanned thirteen years before it was finally dismissed in 1982, included testimony from 974 witnesses with resulting transcripts that totaled over one hundred thousand pages. The operation to digitize the deposition transcripts during the trial was so prodigious that it required a staff of dedicated keypunch operators large enough to fill a facility the size of a football field in White Plains, New York, where IBM’s Data Processing Division was headquartered. While the suit itself proved extremely costly for IBM, its transcript digitization efforts provided the CSR group with their largest and most robust text collection, resulting in a corpus of one hundred million words. Finally, the CSR group discovered the Hansard corpus, a collection of digitized transcripts of the Canadian Parliament official proceedings in both English and French, in the mid-1980s and incorporated an additional hundred million words from its English text into their language model.</p>

<p>In 1976, their ASR system had already reached state of the art performance. On the same task as the ARPA project, it reached higher accuracy, and only took 30 MIP to process 1 second of speech. <span class="citation" data-cites="reddySpeechRecognitionMachine1976">(<a href="#ref-reddySpeechRecognitionMachine1976" role="doc-biblioref">D. R. Reddy 1976</a>)</span> Though logical ASR continued with systems like Hearsay-II (1980), as the 1980s went on, none could deny the practical success of statistical ASR anymore, even if, compared to logical ASR, statistical ASR was far from linguistic theories of human speech recognition.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, all state of the art ASR were statistical, usually HMM-based. Such a model has multiple levels.</p>
<p>At the top level, there is a Markov chain that serves as a language model, which emits individual words. This is usually an n-gram model, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is usually 3. In such a model, each node is a 3-gram. For example, the model can have state transitions like “- - what” → “- what is” → “what is the” → “is the last” → …, and it would emit “what”, “is”, “the”, “last”, …</p>
<p>This sequence of words is then converted to a sequence of phonemes, like “wɒtɪzðəlɑːst”. Each phoneme, like “ɪ”, corresponds to a trained Markov chain. That is, we have a Markov chain with around 3 to 5 states that emits feature vectors corresponding to a possible pronunciation of “ɪ”.</p>
<p>We can even hand-write such a Markov chain, as an example. We would start by collecting many recordings of “ɪ”, then cut these into three parts: the start, the middle, and the end. We convert each part into a feature vector: <span class="math inline">\(v_0, v_1, v_2\)</span>. We give each feature vector a state in the Markov chain. A trajectory through the Markov chain would start at <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>, stay there for a short while, then randomly jump to <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span>, stay there for a long while, and then randomly jump to <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span>, stay there for a short while, and finally jump to the “END” state. We would assign the transition probability <span class="math inline">\(Pr(v_2 | v_2)\)</span> to be roughly <span class="math inline">\(1-1/N\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the average number of 10-ms segments that it takes to pronounce the middle of “ɪ”.</p>
<p>The above system is the basic idea. It does not handle the effect of gliding between phonemes, like how “did you” would be pronounced as “dija”. The standard way to handle this was the triphone model. The triphone model accounts for how a phoneme is changed by its two neighbors. For example, in the previous example, the “ɪ” should really be pronounced in the context of “tɪz”. So, we would have a Markov chain just for “tɪz”, which would generate a sequence of feature vectors that corresponds to how “ɪ” would be pronounced if it appears in the context of “tɪz”. Since English has about 50 phonemes, a triphone model need ~2500 Markov chains, which explains why quad-phone models, or more, had not been popular. Even if one had the appetite for it, there was not enough data to train them.</p>
<p>By late 1990s, the ASR technology stabilized around the gaussian mixture HMM <span class="citation" data-cites="huangHistoricalPerspectiveSpeech2014">(<a href="#ref-huangHistoricalPerspectiveSpeech2014" role="doc-biblioref">Huang, Baker, and Reddy 2014</a>)</span>, where the lowest level of HMM does not emit a feature vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model">gaussian mixture distribution</a> <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i p_i \mathcal N(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)\)</span> of feature vectors. You can add even more epicycles upon epicycles to account for more complex features like omitting phonemes, phonotactic constraints, prosody, etc.</p>

<p>Unlike in the case of MT, the collapse of logical AI in ASR was decisive. Statistical ASR completely replaced logical ASR in the 1990s, after which logical ASR was never revived. There were two reasons for this. One is the familiar scaling story of data and compute:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As computers increased in power, ever greater tracts of the heuristic wasteland opened up for colonization by probabilistic models. As greater quantities of recorded data became available, these areas were tamed by automatic training techniques. Today… almost every aspect of most speech recognition systems is dominated by probabilistic models with parameters determined from data.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="churchIntroductionSpecialIssue1993">(<a href="#ref-churchIntroductionSpecialIssue1993" role="doc-biblioref">K. W. Church and Mercer 1993</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is the public benchmark culture. The ARPA SUR project not only demonstrated that ASR was possible, but also gave rise to the benchmark-focused culture of ASR, which allowed the best methods to rapidly spread through the community:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ARPA (and then DARPA) funded a number of new speech research programs, beginning with 1000-word speaker-independent read-speech tasks like “Resource Management” (Price et al., 1988), recognition of sentences read from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Broadcast News domain (LDC 1998, Graff 1997) (transcription of actual news broadcasts, including quite difficult passages such as on-the-street interviews) and the Switchboard, CallHome, CallFriend, and Fisher domains (Godfrey et al.&nbsp;1992, Cieri et al.&nbsp;2004) (natural telephone conversations between friends or strangers). The ARPA competitions resulted in wide-scale borrowing of techniques among labs since it was easy to see which ideas reduced errors the previous year, and the competitions were probably an important factor in the eventual spread of the HMM paradigm.</p>

<p>This was not the end of the history, however. Once ASR became a statistical problem, one immediately has the problem of feature engineering. Here, the history is similar to that of vision. One begins by imitating the human phoneticians with a nearest-neighbor matching to phonemes, and proceeds to handcrafted features computed over the audio spectrogram, to NN features learned over transforms of the spectrogram, and finally to NN features learned directly over the spectrogram. <span class="citation" data-cites="huangHistoricalPerspectiveSpeech2014">(<a href="#ref-huangHistoricalPerspectiveSpeech2014" role="doc-biblioref">Huang, Baker, and Reddy 2014</a>)</span> However, the story must be left for a future essay.</p>

<p>What was so radical about Jelinek’s approach?</p>
<p>One, to believe in the probabilistic system at all was a breakthrough during the Chomskyan period. As Liberman recounts in an anecdote in the 1970s:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Kenneth Church was] applying context-free parsing to phonotactic speech recognition, assuming a non-stochastic grammar. I suggested that Ken should find or create a collection of phonetic transcriptions, and use it to associate probabilities with his rewrite rules. Ken’s response was to quote Richard Nixon’s remark about Daniel Ellsberg: “We could kill him–but that would be wrong.” Further discussion elicited a quote from one of his AI lab professors: “If you need to count higher than one, you’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p>Two, to throw away preconceptions of what the language model could be, and let results speak. He proceeded directly to using a 3-gram not because it resembles anything like how people really produce language, but because it works.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the future the design of a LM for a naturally generated text will probably involve considerations of syntax. semantics. and discourse pragmatics. So far no one has accomplished this.</p>

<p>Three, to believe in the power of big data and big compute.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our models are derived from as much actual speech data as we can obtain and handle computationally. We have devised methods of automatic model computation, thus minimizing or completely eliminating human intervention. Our strategies are not based on rules developed from trying to intuit how people recognize sentences (as is prevalent elsewhere), although the basic structure of our models is, of course, man-made. This approach is both more accurate and more flexible; as the speaker or the components of the system change, our self-organizing programs remain valid, and computer time is all that is required to adjust to a new configuration.</p>

<p>More presciently, he was even considering the possibility of throwing away the preconceptions of what the features could be, and let data speak:</p>

<p>Previous MT systems typically performs multi-step processing on a raw audio signal, and somewhere in the middle, the audio signal would be transformed into a phonetic transcription. Jelinek, instead of following tradition and featurize audio into a list of phonemes (“an artificial phonetician”), just proposed to featurize audio in whatever way that seemed to work better for the system. As far as I see, this was not used in HMM ASR during the 1990s, but we know that automatic feature learning would finally be vindicated by neural networks around 2010 as the encoder-decoder architectures trained fully end-to-end <span class="citation" data-cites="gravesConnectionistTemporalClassification2006 chorowskiEndtoendContinuousSpeech2014">(<a href="#ref-gravesConnectionistTemporalClassification2006" role="doc-biblioref">Graves et al. 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-chorowskiEndtoendContinuousSpeech2014" role="doc-biblioref">Chorowski et al. 2014</a>)</span></p>
<p>In 2005, near the end of his life, Jelinek admitted that his quote was, despite his best hopes, genuine.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Whenever I fire a linguist our system performance improves.</em> I have hoped for many years that this quote was only apocryphal, but at least two reliable witnesses have recently convinced me that I really stated this publicly in a conference talk (Jelinek, 1998). Accepting then that I really said it, I must first of all affirm that I never fired anyone, and a linguist least of all. So my motivation is defensive: to show that neither I nor my colleagues at IBM ever had any hostility to linguists or linguistics. In fact, we all hoped that linguists would provide us with needed help. We were never reluctant to include linguistic knowledge or intuition into our systems: if we didn’t succeed, it was because we didn’t find an efficient way to do include it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on a lifetime of multiple near-linguistic experiences, Jelinek seemed regretful. It is not that he wanted to fire linguists, it was simply that, somehow, attempting to incorporate linguistic expertise hurt performance. He died in 2010, just in time to miss the deep learning revolution that fired the last linguists.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the statistical model of language with which he had so successfully replaced linguistic rules was a simple word trigram – i.e.&nbsp;a very crude model of three word sequences. Whilst it was obvious to everyone that this model was hopelessly impoverished, in practice it had proved almost impossible to improve on. However, in the year 2000, Fred published a paper with one of his students called “Structured language modeling for speech recognition”. It sets out a principled way to incorporate linguistics into a statistical framework and as well as representing a significant step forward in language modeling, it has helped bridge the gap between speech engineers and the hitherto diverging computational linguistics community. In 2002, it received a “Best Paper” award and the citation read “for work leading to significant advances in the representation and automatic learning of syntactic structure in statistical language models”. It seemed somehow fitting that 25 years after starting the movement towards statistical approaches, Fred sought to re-engage with aspects of more traditional linguistics. I hope Chomsky read the paper and enjoyed it as much as we speech technologists did.</p>

<p>While this section is titled “Speech”, we have only discussed speech-to-text. Naturally, there is also the direction of text-to-speech (TTS). Here the history is more compressed, if for the simple reason that humans are <em>really good</em> at understanding speech. Even the most primitive kinds of text-to-speech was usable, and it was merely a matter of making it cheaper and less robotic-sounding. Indeed, a very early TTS synthesized speech by gluing together magnetic tape recordings and playing the whole thing at once. <span class="citation" data-cites="harrisStudyBuildingBlocks1953">(<a href="#ref-harrisStudyBuildingBlocks1953" role="doc-biblioref">Harris 1953</a>)</span></p>
<p>At the forefront of speech synthesis research was Bell Labs, which was trying to compress and decompress speech to fit more telephone calls into telephone cables. In 1961 at Bell Labs, an IBM 7094 sang “Daisy Bell”. Arthur Clarke, while visiting his friend John Pierce (this is the last time we’ll see him), saw a demo of this, and he was so impressed that he put this scene into <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (1968). <span class="citation" data-cites="woodRecollectionsJohnRobinson1991">(<a href="#ref-woodRecollectionsJohnRobinson1991" role="doc-biblioref">Wood and Pierce 1991</a>)</span></p>

<p>In 1983, Digital Equipment Corporation started selling one of the first commercially successful TTS system, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtalk">DECTalk</a>, at the low price of $4000. It was based on the Klattalk formant synthesizer of Dennis Klatt, who had dedicated his life to research on speech, and had the best TTS system available at the time. In a 1987 review of TTS <span class="citation" data-cites="klattReviewTexttospeechConversion1987">(<a href="#ref-klattReviewTexttospeechConversion1987" role="doc-biblioref">Klatt 1987</a>)</span>, Klatt stayed close to the Chomskyan orthodoxy and described TTS as a problem of writing the generative grammar deeper down, from text all the way to the spectrogram of the physical sound.</p>

<p>In his literature review, Klatt did take notice of two upstart systems from the statistical side, one being <a href="https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/backstory-of-backpropagation/index.html#terence-sejnowski">NETtalk of Sejnowski</a>, a neural network model, and another being a statistical TTS system very similar to the IBM alignment model, by the same IBM team. He brushed both off as being inferior to a logical TTS system:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When evaluated on the words of this training set, [NETtalk] was correct for about 90% of the phonemes and stress patterns. In some sense, this is a surprisingly good result in that so much knowledge could be embedded in a moderate number of about 25000 weights, but the performance is not nearly as accurate as that of a good set of letter-to-sound rules (performing without use of an exceptions dictionary, but with rules for recognizing common affixes)… [The IBM alignment] approach still results in an inferior words-correct error rate compared with traditional rule systems. Even a very powerful statistical package cannot yet discover much of the underlying structure in a process as complex as natural language… given the attention that NETtalk and other neuron-like devices have received recently, it is disturbing that NETtalk does not learn training set data perfectly, appears to make generalizations suboptimally, and has an overall performance that is not acceptable for a practical system. Furthermore, it is unlikely that larger training lexicons would converge to a more acceptable performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, though the word “rules” appears over 200 times in the review, the above dismissal was the only thing he had to say about learning-based methods. Hostility towards machine learning is a recurring feature among the Chomskyans. However, unlike the Chomskyans, Klatt was not going to be satisfied with writing toy respected the extreme complexity of a proper system of rules. And try he did:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The hard part of text-to-speech synthesis is to calculate a string of LPC data, or formant-synthesis parameters, not from recorded speech, but from the letters and symbols of typed text… It’s possible to write a simple program for this task, which produces robotlike speech-hard to understand and unpleasant to listen to. The alternative, which only Dennis Klatt and a few others have pursued, is to invest years of effort in devising an increasingly lengthy and subtle set of rules to eliminate the robotic accent.</p>
<p>He turns to a table with two volumes about the size of large world atlases, each stuffed with speech spectrograms… Spectrograms usually feature subtle and easily changing patterns. Klatt’s task has been to reduce these subtleties to rules so that a computer can routinely translate ordinary text into appropriate spectrograms. “I’ve drawn a lot of lines on these spectrograms, made measurements by ruler, tabulated the results, typed in numbers, and done computer analyses,” says Klatt.</p>
<p>As Klatt puts it, “Why doesn’t DECtalk sound more like my original voice, after years of my trying to make it do so? According to the spectral comparisons, I’m getting pretty close. But there’s something left that’s elusive, that I haven’t been able to capture. It has been possible to introduce these details and to resynthesize a very good quality of voice. But to say, ‘here are the rules, now I can do it for any sentence’ – that’s the step that’s failed miserably every time.”</p>
<p>But he has hope: “It’s simply a question of finding the right model.”</p>

<p>Since a perceptron-only architecture is not the right way, they illustrated what they believe to be the “right” way to do computer vision by describing in detail the scene analysis algorithm. In short, it starts by discovering edges, then performs some computational geometry on them to recover outlines of basic shapes, such as cubes, then fills in the faces, then fills in the bodies between the faces. The algorithm had to do something clever to deal with occlusions. In the end, a complete 3D scene populated with 3D objects is recovered.</p>

<p>WWII was said to be a war of the physicists, or the code-breakers. It could equally said to be a war of the economists. The side that could sustain a higher industrial output slowly but surely ground down the other side, as strategic bombing destroyed industrial production.</p>
<p>It is either a myth or an obvious point that the soviet union had a bad economic system. In either case, there were two Soviet Nobel laureates in economics. The first was Wassily Leontief, who saw economics not as a simple feedforward network of wheat-to-bread-to-stomach, but as a feedback network of hundreds of industries making commodities for and taking commodities from each other, as made clear in his PhD thesis <em>The Economy as Circular Flow</em> (1928).</p>
<p>Leaving the Soviet Union as a dissident in 1925, he settled in America and performed his input-output analysis of the American economy. Let us divide the economy into <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sectors, from “agriculture” to “electricity” to “rubber”. For simplicity, suppose each sector <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> only makes one kind of commodity <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> – “agriculture” only outputs a generic kind of “food”, etc. Each sector <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, in order to create one unit of commodity <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>, requires some commodities <span class="math inline">\(A_{1i}, A_{2i}, \dots, A_{Ni}\)</span> as inputs. Then, if the entire economy produces <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\)</span>, then it requires total input <span class="math inline">\(Ax\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the demand matrix. With this we have the fundamental equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x = Ax + y
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the surplus that comes out of the economy, which Leontieff calls “demand”, since that is what is demanded by consumers outside of the economic production. It seems simplistic – just a linear equation? Yet this was the origin of linear programming.</p>
<p>In 1949, Leontief used an early computer at Harvard and data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to divide the U.S. economy into 500 sectors, and balanced the linear equation on the grand scale.</p>

<p>Near the end of the war, Stigler wrote a paper calculating what is the cheapest possible nutritionally complete diet. He concluded that at 1939 prices, a minimal viable diet cost $40 per year for an adult American man, which was 1/3 the price of previous results. He concluded that the previous dieticians were not ruthless enough, and confused biological needs with cultural needs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The dieticians take account of the palatability of foods, variety of diet, prestige of various foods, and other cultural facets of consumption. Primarily on such grounds can one explain their emphasis on meats and the inclusion of sugar… If the dieticians persist in presenting minimum diets, they should at least report separately the physical and cultural components of these diets.</p>

<p>In 1947, George Dantzig was tasked with the US Air Force to mechanize its planning. Inspired by the paper as well as Leontief’s input-output analysis, he thought that constraint-optimization with linear algebra was just the tool to use. As a start, he attacked the same problem of diet, and from there, he developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex method</a>. <span class="citation" data-cites="dantzigDietProblem1990">(<a href="#ref-dantzigDietProblem1990" role="doc-biblioref">Dantzig 1990</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the fall of 1947 … undertook as a test of the newly proposed simplex method the determination of a least cost adequate diet based on Stigler’s data. It was the first “large scale” computation in the field. The system consisted of 9 equations in 77 unknowns. Jack parcelled out a different 8 or 9 columns (of the 77 columns) to each of the 9 clerks who were assigned to process them. Using hand-operated desk calculators… the 9 clerks took approximately 120 man-days to obtain an optimal solution of $39.69. Stigler’s heuristic solution was only off from the true annual optimal cost by 24 cents: not bad!</p>

<p>While linear programming became the great success story of early AI – when it was still considered as the “mechanization of thought process”, and often subsumed under operations research – and was quickly taken up by military logisticians and business managers, its original application in diet planning was less successful. Dantzig recounts how he unsuccessfully tried to go on a diet by running a 500-ingredient linear programming problem on an IBM 701. Hilarity ensues.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One day I said to Anne, my wife, “Today is Der Tag, whatever the 701 says that’s what I want you to feed me each day starting with supper tonight.” … I then read off the amounts of foods in the optimal diet. Her reaction: “The diet is a bit weird but conceivable. Is that it?” “Not exactly,” I replied, “AND 500 gallons of vinegar.” … It turned out that our data source listed vinegar as a very weak acid with water content = zero. Therefore, according to the way the model was formulated the more vinegar you drank the greater would be your feeling of feeling full. I decided that vinegar wasn’t a food.</p>
<p>The next day the above scene was repeated except this time … calling for the consumption of 200 bouillon cubes per day… I called my doctor and asked him how come the nutritional requirements didn’t show a limit on the amount of salt? “Isn’t too much salt dangerous?” He replied that it wasn’t necessary; most people had enough sense not to consume too much. I placed an upper bound of three on the number of bouillon cubes consumed per day. That was how upper bounds on variables in linear programming first began.</p>
<p>The next day the above scene was repeated, except this time the diet called, among other things, for two pounds of bran per day… The model was revised with an upper bound put on the amount of bran. The next day the proposed menu was almost exactly the same except this time it was two pounds of blackstrap molasses which substituted for the bran… she said, “I have been studying the various menus the computer has been generating. There are some good ideas there that I can use. I’ll put you on MY diet. She did and I lost 22 pounds.</p>

<p>In our hindsight, we say that the AI performed an adversarial attack on the input data and the reward model misspecification, something that gaming and planning AI are wont to do.</p>
<p>The second Soviet Nobel laureate, Leonid Kantorovich, managed to win it while remaining <em>within</em> the USSR. This was no small feat, for in the USSR, the academic study of economics meant only <em>political</em> economy, and mathematical economics was merely a minor branch of political economy, with mathematical economists having to frame their research as a “critique of bourgeois economic thought”. <span class="citation" data-cites="boldyrevCulturesMathematicalEconomics2017">(<a href="#ref-boldyrevCulturesMathematicalEconomics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Boldyrev and Kirtchik 2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>Like Dantzig, Kantorovich discovered linear programming in the context of a practical problem. Feeling burnt out by too much pure math, he decided to do something practical for a change of scenery, and to do something about the imminent threat of Nazi Germany. So he went to a plywoord factory in 1937, and worked on how to cut plywood sheets in such a way as to meet a specified assortment of pieces with minimum waste. And just like Dantzig, he reduced the problem to a maximization problem with linear objective and linear inequality constraints.</p>
<p>Dizzy with success, he tried the same trick again and again, and accidentally improved efficiency so much that he almost ended up in jail.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… one of the major materials handling operations at the Leningrad E. I. Egorov Railroad Car Building Plant was the cutting of sheet metal for railroad cars. Ordinarily, this cutting produced tremendous quantities of scrap. After introducing Kantorovich’s solution technique to the problem of minimizing waste, officials were able to reduce the amount of scrap by 50%. This had the unfortunate side effect of greatly reducing the amount of scrap metal available to steel plants in the region, and Kantorovich was ordered to appear at Leningrad party headquarters for allegedly sabotaging the economy. In this instance, he was rescued by the military, which needed him for its atomic program.</p>
<p>According to Stalin, the planned economy of the USSR was already “<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Головокружение_от_успехов">dizzy with success</a>”; hence any criticism of it was anti-Soviet propaganda, a serious crime. In particular, anyone openly suggesting that waste could be cut substantially was at great personal risk. Nevertheless, Kantorovich … wrote a letter to Gosplan suggesting a reform of the price system used in planning.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="gardnerLVKantorovichPrice1990">(<a href="#ref-gardnerLVKantorovichPrice1990" role="doc-biblioref">Gardner 1990</a>)</span></p>

<p>Being a socially clueless nerd was not the stuff of romantic comedy in Soviet Russia, but gallows comedy. Fortunately for mathematical economics, his luck held:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Gosplan wrote back saying that no such reform was necessary. This outcome was rather fortunate for its author, as similar letters critical of the authorities – for example, one by Solzhenitsin – landed their authors promptly in jail.</p>

<p>Reading Kantorovich’s repeated attempts to reform Soviet economy, I imagined those old silent movies where a protagonist stumbles around, blindfolded, crossing a highway where the cars always <em>just missed</em>. Accidental economic sabotage was not the end of his misadventures, however. His luck was really tested when it came to the “shadow price” affair.</p>
<p>Consider the problem of managing a factory. It has some input constraints (fuel, woods, etc), and the objective of maximizing the total utility of output goods. This is simply solved by the Lagrangian multiplier method, and it turns out that the Lagrangian multipliers themselves have a natural interpretation: the multiplier <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span> is the amount of extra utility that the factory can achieve, if the factory were to obtain one more unit of constraint <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>So Kantorovich had the great idea of calling it the “shadow price”,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and considered it a way to find the proper price of something, better than the free market mechanism. The free market mechanism leads to maximizing some kind of utility function, but that utility function is not designed by anyone. In contrast, the shadow price naturally falls out of attempts to maximize a social utility function designed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan">Gosplan (State Planning Committee)</a>. It is a utility designed by humans, for humans, not a utility function emergent from capitalism, for capitalism.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn13"><p><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;In his original terms, “objectively determined valuation” [объективно обусловленные оценки], where the “objectively” means “according to an objective function (the social utility function)”.</p></div></div><p>This is, in short, how market socialism should work, according to Kantorovich:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Design a social utility function (the “social” part of “socialism”).</li>
<li>Collect data on how the factories <em>should ideally</em> work (big data).</li>
<li>Compute the shadow prices by linear programming (big compute).</li>
<li>Set the prices on every commodity.</li>
<li>Let the factories compete on this market for goods and money, secure in the knowledge that this socialist market would maximize a properly designed social utility, and the market mechanism would allow only the factories that achieve the highest efficiency: The slackers are competed out, and only those who can perform as efficiently as the “ideal factories” (see step 2) can make a profit and thus survive.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole thing is not hard to prove in a simple model of economy, where all factories are linear functions, and the social utility function is also a linear function. Then the proof is just writing down the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_linear_program">linear duality theorem</a>”, and interpreting it as economics.</p>

<p>[Boyarskii:] You write, “any increase in the requirements of some article entails a corresponding increase in costs and consequently in its o.d. valuation. A decrease in requirements entails a reduction in its o.d. valuation.” What is this, what can this possibly be, but a suggestion that value is determined by supply and demand? Supply and demand, for heaven’s sake: bourgeois ideology’s most transparent disguise for exploitation!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Kantorovich:] It’s true that there is a formal resemblance, but they have a completely different origin, and therefore a completely different meaning. Whereas market prices are formed spontaneously, objective valuations – shadow prices – must be computed on the basis of an optimal plan. As the plan targets change, the valuations change. They are subordinate to the very different production relationships of a socialist society. Yet, yet, the scope for their use is actually bigger under socialism. The capitalists actually agree with you, Dr Boyarskii, that the mathematical methods we’re talking about should only be applied on the small scale, on the level of the individual firm. They have no choice: there is no larger structure, in the economy of West Germany or the United States, in which they can be set to work. They have had some success, I believe. I’m sorry to say that, since George Danzig and Tjalling Koopmans made their discoveries of “linear programming” in America during the war, the techniques have been adopted there far more eagerly, far more quickly, than in the Soviet Union. Linear programmers in the USA calculate routes for airlines, and devise the investment policies of Wall Street corporations. But we still have an opportunity before us which is closed to the capitalists. Capitalism cannot calculate an optimum for a whole economy at once. We can. There is a fundamental harmony between optimal planning and the nature of socialist society.</p>

<p>Circa 1900, as mathematicians learned to manufacture paradoxes, mathematics modernized, upgraded paranoia, and tried to get a grip. The angel of topology and the devil of abstract algebra fought for the soul of each individual mathematical domain in this “Foundational Crisis”. With palpable disdain, Poincaré deplored the Hilbert school of formal logic that threatened to bleed even geometry of meaning:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Imagine,” says Hilbert,” three kinds of things, which we will call points, straight lines, and planes; let us agree that a straight line shall be determined by two points, and that, instead of saying that this straight line is determined by these two points, we may say that it passes through these two points, or that these two points are situated on the straight line.” What these things are, not only do we not know, but we must not seek to know… We might replace geometry by the reasoning piano imagined by Stanley Jevons; or, if we prefer, we might imagine a machine where we should put in axioms at one end and take out theorems at the other, like that legendary machine in Chicago where pigs go in alive and come out transformed into hams and sausages. It is no more necessary for the mathematician than it is for these machines to know what he is doing.</p>

<p>The working of Logic Theorist was simple. It simply performs a tree search in the space of possible proofs. At the root of the tree is the theorem to be proved. Each branch then transforms the state of the proof, adding assumptions (which then become sub-goals that themselves need to be proved), substitute logical variables, quoting axioms, perform modus ponens, etc. If at some leaf-node, the list of goals is empty, then the solution is found, and the Logical Theorist backtracks to get the final proof.</p>
<p>As an example, it proved Theorem 2.17 as follows. The final proof had 7 steps, and took 89k basic operations to discover. <span class="citation" data-cites="newellHumanProblemSolving1972">(<a href="#ref-newellHumanProblemSolving1972" role="doc-biblioref">Allen Newell and Simon 1972, 133</a>)</span></p>

<p>Simon and Newell were unhappy with Logic Theorist, for the simple reason that when they read the trace-outs of its “thought process”, they noted that it is very different from how humans would go about proving the same problems. Patiently plodding, they brute forced through the whole search tree, whereas humans would tastefully pick some branches and search deeply, and others not at all.</p>
<p>In their magnum opus, <em>Human Problem Solving</em> (1972), they have compiled their decades of research into a definitive statement of what AI is about in their view. According to them, AI is logical AI, and the fundamental architecture for logical AI is Information Processing System. <span class="citation" data-cites="newellHumanProblemSolving1972">(<a href="#ref-newellHumanProblemSolving1972" role="doc-biblioref">Allen Newell and Simon 1972</a>)</span></p>
<p>The axioms of logical AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is symbols all the way down. Everything “sub-symbolic”, like the neural biology, are just implementation, and not part of what intelligence is about, much like software is independent of hardware.</li>
<li>Intelligent behavior is the combination of simple goals, simple algorithms, and complex environment.</li>
<li>Intelligent algorithms are fairly simple, and consist of serial, deterministic, heuristic search over the space of solutions.</li>
<li>The space of solutions is structured like a directed graph, where the edges are “generators” or “search operators”.</li>
<li>At each step, the search algorihm runs a “verifier” subroutine to check if a solution has been found. If so, then it backtracks to produce the full solution. If not, then it updates an internal state and uses a heuristic to decide which edge to follow next.</li>
</ul>
<p>They called their vision of logical AI the “General Problem Solver” (GPS), a grandiose title for a grandiose dream.</p>

<p>As we have seen and will see, the relation between Chomsky and logical AI runs deep.</p>
<p>The IPS is not just an algorithm for AI, but also a psychological theory for what humans really do when they solve problems. As such, Simon and Newell spent over a decade carefully studying the behavior of real humans solving real problems, such as propositional logic proofs (the same task as Logic Theorist), cryptograms, chess puzzles, and so on. And by “detailed” I mean it. They had subjects working through problems in a lab, with the entire session tape-recorded, fully transcribed, annotated, and parsed into the form of a heuristic tree search. It was like looking at the debugger output to a human being.</p>

<p>In a popularization (well, as popular as abstract AI theories can get), Simon analogized their theory with a crawling ant:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We watch an ant make his laborious way across a wind- and wave- molded beach. He moves ahead, angles to the right to ease his climb up a steep dunelet, detours around a pebble, stops for a moment to exchange information with a compatriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his home. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I sketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregular, angular segments–not quite a random walk, for it has an underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal. I show the unlabeled sketch to a friend. Whose path is it? An expert skier, perhaps, slaloming down a steep and somewhat rocky slope. Or a sloop, beating upwind in a channel dotted with islands or shoals. Perhaps it is a path in a more abstract space: the course of search of a student seeking the proof of a theorem in geometry… Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p>At this point, we might be seeing a pattern here. Checking every use of the word “learning” in the book, I confirmed that, indeed, they were uninterested in learning, other than claiming that learning consists of adding more symbols to the internal environment, which is just one more kind of environment. One can look up lemmas and formulas on an external book, or an internal blackboard. It is all the same. The ant of the brain just need to crawl over the inner landscape as much as it crawls over the outer landscape.</p>

<p>It is not that they completely ignored the problem of learning, but rather, they understood learning as a simple kind of associative memorization. Feigenbaum’s PhD project was the Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM), an algorithmic model of human associative memory. As a concrete realization of the learning theory of Simon and Newell, we describe it to show how little learning their framework contained.</p>
<p>EPAM modeled people performing the following memorization task:</p>
<ul>
<li>“DAX” is displayed to the subject</li>
<li>Subject should say “JIR” in response</li>
<li>Regardless of what subject responds, “JIR” is displayed after a few seconds.</li>
<li>Repeat this until the subject manages to memorize all 12 pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>During a session, every time EPAM sees a new stimulus-response pair, it stores the response, and updates its decision tree. Each node of the decision tree has two children, and which way EPAM goes is determined by testing one letter of the stimulus. It looks like</p>

<p>In introductions to AI or even just machine learning. Arthur Samuel’s checker program was usually given as the first great example of machine learning.

So my bet is 2 plies. Indeed, the paper appendix says it takes <span class="math inline">\(10^{-2} \;\mathrm{sec}\)</span> to play and evaluate one position, which means it takes about 500 instructions for one play and evaluation, and that searching 2 plies already takes 30 minutes.</p></div></div><ul>
<li>Rote learning: After performing an alpha-beta search, it would store the score for the root node. Later, if the root node is encountered during search, its score would be used without needing to search deeper. This allows it to increase the effective search depth over time, as it memorizes more and more positions’ values. To save memory, if a board does not reappear after a maximum number of moves, it is “forgotten”. The whole system managed to memorize 53,000 board positions (averaging 3.8 words each on a IBM 704)</li>
<li>Generalization learning: Something very similar to TD-learning in reinforcement learnig, except that the reward function is not whether the board is won (1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 otherwise), but the <em>piece advantage</em> feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole program ran on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, and took up about 8000 instructions.</p>
<p>Just when you thought there is finally some learning, nope. Samuel got the features from interviewing the checker experts. In fact, it had a formative influence on a later pioneer of expert systems:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Art Samuel’s work on the checker player: Art had interviewed experts to understand… the feature vector and then he did a good deal of reading about checkers… And the influential part about that was.. his machine learning component – that once you had the expertise in, in a first-order form, it could be improved… automatically.

<p>Compared to checkers, computer chess had been much more high-profile, and it has been a textbook example of logical AI.

<p>Like its predecessors, Deep Blue used alpha-beta tree search, except it searched <em>a lot of positions</em>. To support this, it used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration">VLSI</a> “chess chips”,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> each with four parts: the move generator, the smart-move stack, the evaluation function, and the search control.

<p>I know you are eager to hear about how Deep Blue learned. So did I. The bad news is that it barely learned anything. First, its evaluation function was just a linear sum over ~8000 hand-crafted features,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> with changeable linear weights. It actually had two evaluation functions, fast and slow. Only if the fast one already shows a clear advantage would the slow one be called. Further, the linear weights were mostly handcrafted too, except a small amount of automation:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn16"><p><sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And there were a lot of features, with words I barely understand:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The most significant part of the fast evaluation is the “piece placement” value, i.e., the sum of the basic piece values with square-based location adjustments. Positional features that can be computed quickly, such as “pawn can run”, are also part of the fast evaluation. The slow evaluation scans the chess board one column at a time, computing values for chess concepts such as square control, pins, X-rays, king safety, pawn structure, passed pawns, ray control, outposts, pawn majority, rook on the 7th, blockade, restraint, color complex, trapped pieces, development, and so on. The features recognized in both the slow and fast evaluation functions have programmable weights, allowing their relative importance to be easily adjusted.</p>

</div></div><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first tool had the goal of identifying features in the Deep Blue I evaluation function that were “noisy”, i.e., relatively insensitive to the particular weights chosen… A hill-climbing approach was used to explore selected features (or feature subsets), and those that did not converge were candidates for further hand examination… A second tool was developed with the goal of tuning evaluation function weights. This tool used a comparison training methodology to analyze weights related to pawn shelter. Training results showed that the hand-tuned weights were systematically too low, and they were increased prior to the 1997 match. There is some evidence that this change led to improved play.</p>

<p>10 years after the historic win, Hsu wrote a brief essay describing how to make a superhuman Go machine.

<p>… with some optimization a machine that can search a trillion positions per second would be enough to play Go at the very highest level.

<p>so fluid was its play that the grandmasters in attendance all understood Benjamin’s contention that Blue “played real chess” that day.

Instead it took a subtler but superior tack that wound up to be near decisive in defeating Kasparov. After the champ resigned, he rushed back to his Plaza suite, cranked up his own computers and tried in vain to understand how a hunk of sand and metal could have understood chess so deeply. Apparently this puzzlement crossed into the realm of suspicion: the Kasparov camp was soon demanding to see Deep Blue’s printouts. “It was a masterpiece by computer”, said Kasparov second Michael Khodarkovsky. “We would like to understand why it was possible.” (Eventually, a neutral arbiter examined the printout.) Later Kasparov blurted out his real complaint. “Suddenly [Deep Blue] played like a god for one moment,” he said.</p>

<p>What was new about expert systems? Compared to previous AI systems like the GPS, which had the elegance of a short mathematical program, expert systems were meant to work only with a large enough knowledge base. This was an early appearance of <em>data</em> in AI, compared to the previous kind of algorithm-centric AI. From our scaling-hypothesis point of view, the appearance of data was a step in the right direction, but it was yet incomplete, since the data was heavily distilled by human experts into rules.</p>
<p>The previous approach to logical AI focused on general algorithms (usually search) and problem representation. In short, the promise of logical AI (or at least, the kind of logical AI that expert systems were challenging) is this:</p>

<p>That is, most of AI work was in two areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient search algorithms over general “problem spaces”.</li>
<li>Representations of data for effective search.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the general algorithms side, examples included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> developed for Shakey the robot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping">dynamic time warping</a> developed for speech recognition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">KMP algorithm</a> for string matching, etc. While it is anachronistic, a good example of non-trivial data representation for effective search is the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">bitboard</a> used for computer chess. It represents the entire chess board with a bit array in a clever way, so that many operations, like finding which pieces are attacking a square, becomes bitwise operations, allowing fast game tree search.</p>
<p>In a position paper coauthored by Feigenbaum and Lenat, we have a clear statement of the assumptions behind expert systems AI.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Knowledge is Power” or, more cynically “Intelligence is in the eye of the (uninformed) beholder.”</p>
<p>The Knowledge Principle (KP): A system exhibits intelligent understanding and action at a high level of competence primarily because of the specific knowledge that it can bring to bear: the concepts, facts, representations, methods, models, metaphors, and heuristics about its domain of endeavor… Knowledge is often considered Compiled Search; despite that, the KP claims that only a small portion of the knowledge can be generalized so it applies across domains, without sacrificing most of its power.</p>
<p>Explicit Knowledge Principle: Much of the knowledge in an intelligent system needs to be represented explicitly.</p>
<p>The Competence Threshold: Difficult tasks succumb nonlinearly to knowledge. There is an ever greater “payoff” to adding each piece of knowledge, up to some level of competence (e.g., where an NP complete problem becomes Polynomial). Beyond that, additional knowledge is useful but not frequently needed (e.g., handling rare cases.). Crossing the Competence Threshold, one enters the realm of experts. There, the knowledge-search tradeoff is fairly evenly balanced.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The focus of AI research changed from problem-solving algorithms (usually search) and problem representations to knowledge representation and acquisition (manual or automatic), with a little bit of inference engine on top. There was apparently a persistent confusion as to the point of expert systems, however, since even deep into the AI boom period, people still often thought the expert system shell was “the AI” that the AI companies were selling, even when it’s the knowledge engineering that they sold. It was kind of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game">shell game</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The idea was that there was a piece of magic that was the AI and that this magic, plus a software development environment that made it easy to build these things, was salable… Where was the AI? It wasn’t in the inference engine at all. These inference engines were, after all, pretty simple pieces of software that tested to see if the logic of the rules that the knowledge engineers wrote came up with any conclusions. The AI in complex expert systems was in the organization and representation of knowledge, the attempt to understand the domain under study, and the crystallization of what was important in the domain and how experts in the domain reasoned.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-knowledge-bottleneck">The knowledge bottleneck</h3>
<p>Knowledge acquisition vs knowledge engineering</p>
<p>In the very first paper on DENDRAL, the authors already recognized the problem of “knowledge bottleneck”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>we could get rid of the ‘middle man’ in the information transfer by educating a programmer in mass spectroscopy or by educating a chemist in Lisp. Or we could replace the middle man with a program designed to perform the same function as B (the layman/programmer) in the dialog above. In effect, we have been moving slowly in all three of these directions at once. But what we would most like to pursue is the design of a program to elicit information from an expert who is not also a programmer.</p>
<p>One obvious reason for the encouragingly high level of performance of the computer is the large amount of mass spectrometry knowledge which chemists have imparted to the program. Yet this has been one of the biggest bottlenecks in developing the program. When there was only one theory of mass spectrometry in the program, viz., the complex theory in the PREDICTOR, we were relatively insensitive to the difficulty of adding new information to the theory. Although it was a time-consuming process, it was still manageable by one programmer, working with one chemist, with most of the time spent programming as opposed to criticizing. By the time the planning phase was added to the program, it was easier to see how to shorten the task of programming by separating the chemical theory from the routines which work on the theory. The separation was by no means complete here, but it was successful enough to reduce the programming time drastically for the addition of new pieces of theory. Because the theory could be changed by changing an entry in a table, many iterations with the expert were now possible in a single one or two hour session at the console. The preponderance of time was now spent by the chemist deciding how to change the rules in the table to bring the program’s behaviour more in line with real data. The organization of the PRELIMINARY INFERENCE MAKER made the process of examining its chemical knowledge relatively simple, compared to the process of putting knowledge into the sTRUCTURE GENERATOR and PREDICTOR programs. Both of these programs are on their way to becoming ‘table driven’ in much the same way as the PRELIMINARY INFERENCE MAKER is now. (See Part 4.) Yet, re-designing the programs to allow easyadditions and changes to the chemical knowledge will not solve all ourproblems. Because mass spectroscopy is a relatively young discipline, the theory does not exist in any sort of comprehensive codified form. Part 2 will discuss some of the problems of obtaining the chemical theory that has been incorporated into the programs so far. Further, the presence of any body of knowledge in the programs brings up questions of how and where this knowledge is to be represented, stored, and referenced within the programs. Part 3 will elaborate on these issues</p>

<p>The power of the expert systems comes from the knowl- edge they contain. That knowledge is, at present, stored in the heads of human experts, and getting it out—what AI researchers call the knowledge acquisition problem—is the biggest bottleneck that the knowledge engineers currently face. Expert systems are now proven performers. But knowledge acquisition is the great research problem that AI laboratories must face and solve in the coming decade.</p>

<p>According to the mythos of AI, after the 1980s hype of AI came second AI winter. This was half correct. The greatest dreams of AI did not pan out, but ES had become practical, invisible, even boring.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The new darling of the media – virtual reality – has supplanted AI as having the potential to merge science fiction with real-world applications… Patrick Albert… pointed out the main problem afflicting the AI industry: “companies have been marketing AI technologies, and not solutions.” … the more invisible AI becomes, the more palatable it becomes to the end-user. The day ofgeneric expert system tools is probably over, Arjimand said, to be replaced by off-the-shelf applications.</p>
<p>Both Monte Zweben, President of Red Pepper Software (San Mateo, CA), and Tom Laffey, Chief Technology Officer of Talarian (Mountain View, CA), had similar stories to tell regarding the successful launch of companies selling real-time expert system tools: never, ever call the products “AI”. “Don’t mention AI if you want any venture capital money,” Laffey warned. “Call it something else, such as advanced decision systems. These days, people come to AI almost as a last resort.” Zweben’s company shared the same fate as Talarian: he had to remove or restate every mention of AI from the Red Pepper prospectus before investors would take him seriously. Despite the literally thousands of successfully deployed intelligent ap- plications, AI’s reputation continues to suffer because nobody is giving credit to the AI component. Zweben suggested wish- fully that AI companies insist on being recognized for their contribution to applications, perhaps even demanding an ‘AI inside’ label, it la Intel’s ‘Intel inside’ label on PCs.</p>

<p>In short, ES behind boring acronyms like Systems Applications and Products (SAP), Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), and Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

Successes include logistics planning, business rules, tax code, bureaucratic rules, . Failures are basically any kind of general intelligence in even slightly unstructured environments.</p>
<p>And knowledge acquisition? Some of it failed, and some of it spun off into “data mining”. Roughly speaking, it consisted of discovering logical rules that are approximately true over a large database. In our time, we might call it data science for the 2000s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Feigenbaum became the Chief Scientist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force">US Air Force</a>, and tried to teach them about software engineering. With regard to technology, the military was still doing it the same way as they did in the 1950s. They prioritized hardware before software, and what software they developed was by the waterfall model they used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi_Automatic_Ground_Environment">SAGE</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="boehmView20th21st2006">(<a href="#ref-boehmView20th21st2006" role="doc-biblioref">Boehm 2006</a>)</span>.

<p>they are one piece of a larger business Solution. That one piece, however, is often what encapsulates and distributes the actual problem-solving capability of the system.’ All told, these systems are responsible for tens of millions of dollars in savings and increased earnings for their developers. TODO source</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harmon: … how many vendors are advertising at the major conferences. When you start to see attendance and vendors dropping off, you know that the market is closing down for some reason. That certainly happened in that expert systems array. The second thing is that expert systems knowledge isn’t a constant… If a company had a knowledge base and passed it to somebody else, it would be certainly at the cutting edge. But it would be out of date within a year or two anyway. The ability of these systems to be maintained, to have people bring them up to date is critical, too.</p>
<p>Peter Friedland: Silicon Valley companies, in general, or venture backed companies, in general. It’s extraordinarily difficult to remain as the same company over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Feigenbaum: I said, “Sato-san [CEO of Fujitsu Laboratories in Japan], what message would you like me to take back to the people in the US about your experience in expert systems?” He said, “Tell them it’s too hard to get the knowledge.”</p>
<p>Brad Allen: It became hard to generate money selling a generic solution… Initially getting into it, the shell was an important thing, but ultimately… The companies that survived were the ones that basically pivoted into a particular area. Inference, for example, pivoted into customer relationship management systems and went public and had a reasonable life over that period of time.</p>
<p>Lenat: it was closer to what Ed and others were saying: the tools were too hard to use; the education and knowledge transfer to the people who would have to build the systems wasn’t there. I was on the Inference advisory board. and I loved ART. It had context and all sorts of wonderful features and truth maintenance. In general, the first thing that the customers would do is turn all that off because it was very complicated… They just used this narrow little tiny iris that wasn’t quite enough for them to get enough traction to make it cost-effective.</p>
<p>Allen: the first generation of expert system companies had an extremely skewed image of what the market was because the federal government was coming in and throwing tons of money into the thing… we shipped and the next month we were doing a million a month in revenue… Once that initial fact-finding effort had gone on within those organizations, they said, “Well, it’s either too expensive or we’re going to do it in-house.”</p>
<p>Haigh: If you’re Peter Hart or Ed Feigenbaum, you can do amazing things, but there aren’t that many Ed Feigenbaum’s and Peter Hart’s around. What it finishes up being is essentially a services business that’s hard to scale because the added value is really coming from being able to do that stuff. How do you scale that up if you sell the tool? You’re saying they turn off all the smart stuff. There isn’t a huge base of people out there who are smart enough and have the right background to do the things that the really smart people can.</p>
<p>Harmon: several of these old expert system tool vendors who then became business rule vendors became part of the business process tool market, and it exists there today… It’s a very easy kind of knowledge to capture. As opposed to interviewing an expert and trying to get them to give you heuristic information, these guys were dealing almost entirely with procedures that had already been stated in a rulebook. In any case, it’s just one variation of what people with this technology went out and found out a niche and did. There was a market for parts of the technology. It just didn’t happen to fit the big model.</p>
<p>Brian McCune: What industry buys, and government to some degree, is solutions. They don’t buy technology. Now, sure, in the first five years, let’s try it out, but at some point, I want solutions. The typical thing that I’ve run into is you talk to a CEO and they say, “What does your product cost? I want to see an ROI within one year, sometimes six months. I want all the money I spent on it back, and every year after that, the same amount. If you’re going to charge me half-a-million dollars for the prototype and you deliver it, a year later I want to know that I’ve saved half-a-million and so on.” I just don’t know that this industry ever got to the level of doing those calculations for its clients.</p>
<p>McCune: I built a system that I can’t say very much about. It was a signal analysis system. I built it for $1 million. Five years later the boss of the boss of the boss of my client said, “Thank you, Brian. You saved me $500 million.” That’s what I’m talking about ROI. He said, “What other systems can you build for me?” I built him two more systems. So, it did pay off for the military.</p>
<p>Feigenbaum: rules-based systems lives on today, very strongly absorbed into the infrastructure of IT. Somebody mentioned yesterday that if you take off the back cover of some system and you look in there there’s a rule-based system in there… It’s not the full base. It’s not the full inference engine. It’s not the full expert system, but the business rules exist.</p>
<p>Feigenbaum: In 1987 dollars, to maintain the famous DEC configuration system cost DEC $2.7 million a year because the products kept changing</p>

<p>Weizenbaum became a fully human-centric critique of AI, culminating with <em>Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation</em> (1976). In brief, the book had theese theses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Computers might be intelligent, but they will never be wise (or to feel emotions, to love, etc). To “calculate” requires just intelligence, but to “judge” requires wisdom.</li>
<li>The development of AI threatens to replace judgment with calculation, which will destroy human dignity. This replacement of judgment with calculation is an absurd political ideology, and must be resisted politically.</li>
<li>If, however, we do not resist, but keep following this political ideology, we would end up with the obviously absurd conclusion that “the brain is merely a meat machine”. <em>Reductio ad absurdum</em>.</li>
<li>This dangerous development of AI did not come from a wise scientific project of understanding how human intelligence works, but from a megalomaniac, obsessive-compulsive desire to make machine parodies of human behavior. The method of AI development was heuristic, empirical, a kind of “I wonder what the machine would do if I write this program…”, without a scientific theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the book came out, it received many reviews, and Weizenbaum wrote replies to these reviews. I found this one the funniest:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have in mind also the teaching urged on us by some leaders of the AI community that there is nothing unique about the human species, that in fact, the embrace of the illusion of human uniqueness amounts to a kind of species prejudice and is unworthy of enlightened intellectuals. If we find nothing abhorrent in the use of artificially sustained, disembodied animal brains as computer components, and if there is nothing that uniquely distinguishes the human species from animal species, then – need I spell out where that idea leads?</p>

<p>The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in normal English dialog. It uses semantic information and context to understand discourse and to disambiguate sentences. It combines a complete syntactic analysis of each sentence with a “heuristic understander” which uses different kinds of information about a sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information about the world in deciding what the sentence means. It is based on the belief that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can “understand” the subject it is discussing. The program is given a detailed model of the knowledge needed by a simple robot having only a hand and an eye. We can give it instructions to manipulate toy objects, interrogate it about the scene, and give it information it will use in deduction. In addition to knowing the properties of toy objects, the program has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carry them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, and asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through use of context and physical knowledge.</p>

<p>One system for medical diagnosis, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CADUCEUS_(expert_system)">CADUCEUS</a> (originally INTERNIST), has 500 disease profiles, 350 disease variations, several thousand symptoms, and 6,500 rules describing relations among symptoms. After fifteen years of development, the system is still not on the market. According to one report, it gave a correct diagnosis in only 75 percent of its carefully selected test cases. Nevertheless, Myers, the medical expert who developed it, “believes that the addition of another 50 [diseases] will make the system workable and, more importantly, practical.”</p>

<p>In 1984, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Lenat">Douglas Lenat</a> began the Cyc project, an ambitious attempt to scale symbolic AI up to the real world. Like most expert systems, the Cyc project consists of a giant knowledge base encoded in a LISP-like symbolic logic language, upon which inference engines can be run to produce logical reasoning. Unlike most expert systems, the ambition of Cyc was universal: Its knowledge base would not be restricted to expert knowledge in a particular domain, but <em>all</em> commonsense knowledge in <em>all</em> domains that humans have commonsense about.</p>
<p>Even from the vantage point of 1985, it was clear to all that there was a lot of commonsense to code in, although few could have predicted that Lenat would persevere at it for over 30 years.</p>
<p>They themselves underestimated the difficulty. In 1990, they confidently titled a paper “Cyc: A midterm report” <span class="citation" data-cites="lenatCycMidtermReport1990">(<a href="#ref-lenatCycMidtermReport1990" role="doc-biblioref">D. Lenat and Guha 1990</a>)</span>, suggesting that they expected to be done around 1995.</p>
<p>The progress report in 1995 stated that, while the system is far from done, they have at least manually entered <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> “general concepts” and <span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> “commonsense axioms” into Cyc, at the price of 100 person-years. <span class="citation" data-cites="lenatCycLargescaleInvestment1995">(<a href="#ref-lenatCycLargescaleInvestment1995" role="doc-biblioref">D.

<p>Moreover, statistics, colocation, and frequency do not resolve such questions. But the task goes from impossible to trivial if one already knows a few things about boxes and pens, police and demonstrators, and water and teakettles. The same sort of chicken-and-egg relationship characterizes CYC and ML because learning occurs at the fringe of what one already knows. Therefore, in the early 1980s, when the rest of the world was so enthusiastic about Natural Language Understanding, Machine Learning, and AI in general, we were pessimistic. We concluded the only way out of this codependency would be to prime the pump by manually crafting a million axioms covering an appreciable fraction of the required knowledge. That knowledge would serve as a critical mass, enabling further knowledge collection through NLU and ML, beginning in the mid-1990s. Mary Shepherd and I embarked on that task in 1984, knowing we had little chance of success, but seeing no alternative but to try… we are now moving toward the transition point where NLU and ML are supported. The rest of the world is disillusioned and pessimistic about symbolic AI, but ironically, as CYC reaches closure, our hopes for NLU and ML in the next 10 years are very high.</p>

<p>… give CYC enough knowledge by the late 1990s to enable it to learn more by means of natural language conversations and reading. Soon thereafter, say by 2001, we planned to have it learning on its own, by automated-discovery methods guided by models or minitheories of the real world. To a large extent, that’s just what we did. At the end of 1994, the CYC program was mature enough to spin off from MCC as a new company – Cycorp – to commercialize the technology and begin its widespread deployment.</p>

<p>Their “midterm report” only accentuates this sense of tragedy, of seeing them fighting impossible odds, and losing. They saw with clarity that there is no shortcut to intelligence, no “Maxwell’s equations of thought”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The majority of work in knowledge representation has dealt with the technicalities of relating predicate calculus to other formalisms and with the details of various schemes for default reasoning. There has almost been an aversion to addressing the problems that arise in actually representing large bodies of knowledge with content. However, deep, important issues must be addressed if we are to ever have a large intelligent knowledge-based program: What ontological categories would make up an adequate set for carving up the universe? How are they related? What are the important facts and heuristics most humans today know about solid objects? And so on. In short, we must bite the bullet.</p>
<p>We don’t believe there is any shortcut to being intelligent, any yet-to-be-discovered Maxwell’s equations of thought, any AI Risc architecture that will yield vast amounts of problem-solving power. Although issues such as architecture are important, no powerful formalism can obviate the need for a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>By knowledge, we don’t just mean dry, almanac-like or highly domain-specific facts. Rather, most of what we need to know to get by in the real world is prescientific (knowledge that is too commonsensical to be included in reference books; for example, animals live for a single solid interval of time, nothing can be in two places at once, animals don’t like pain), dynamic (scripts and rules of thumb for solving problems) and metaknowledge (how to fill in gaps in the knowledge base, how to keep it organized, how to monitor and switch among problem-solving methods, and so on). Perhaps the hardest truth to face, one that AI has been trying to wriggle out of for 34 years, is that there is probably no elegant, effortless way to obtain this immense knowledge base. Rather, the bulk of the effort must (at least initially) be manual entry of assertion after assertion. <span class="citation" data-cites="lenatCycMidtermReport1990">(<a href="#ref-lenatCycMidtermReport1990" role="doc-biblioref">D.

<p>The dream of peace produces war machines. Ancient Athenians dreamed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos">Talos</a>, a bronze giant who defended Crete, while the Jews of Prague dreamed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#Etymology">Golem</a>. The ages has been too kind to Zhuge Liang, and his wheelbarrow, invented for carrying war supplies, became the legend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_ox">wooden robot oxen</a>.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution produced early ideas of feedback mechanism, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor">centrifugal governor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscopic_autopilot">gyro autopilot</a>. It took until WWII for someone to put together high explosives, slow burning fuel, and the feedback mechanism, to create the cruise missile. The first of its kind was the V-1 rocket, which already incorporates the basic features of all cruise missiles.</p>
<p>The V-1 looks like a small unmanned jet airplane. It has the following senses: roll (gyro), pitch (gyro), yaw (magnetic compass), altitude (barometer), distance traveled (vane anemometer). The roll, pitch, yaw, and altitude are maintained by negative feedback. So for example, if the missile is heading east to the set-point of yaw, a valve would open, and compressed gas would force the rudder to turn, which yaws the missile west. As soon as the vane anemometer has turned a designated number, the missile considers itself to have reached the target. It turns off the engine and sharply dives to the ground, and explodes upon impact.</p>
<p>Other than V-1 and V-2, there were no autonomous war machines during WWII, though there were several radio-controlled weapons such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath_tracked_mine">explosive little tanks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioplane_OQ-2">little planes for target practice</a>. Skinner, thinking outside (inside?) the box, worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pigeon">Project Pigeon</a>. He trained pigeons in skinner boxes to peck at the ship appearing on a screen. If the pigeon is pecking on the top-left, then the missile would turn to the bottom-right. In effect, the pigeon becomes the negative feedback controller. Though it was cancelled, it would have been considerably cheaper than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze">the Japanese version</a> should it have ever reached production.</p>

<p>After WWII, some autonomous defense systems were developed and deployed, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-in_weapon_system">close-in weapon systems</a> on ships. These detect incoming incoming missiles and enemy aircraft by radar, computes their trajectories, and shoots them down. Since they must operate on the time-scale of seconds, they are fully automatic with no human in the loop. Despite this, these are quite uncontroversial and do not typically earn the title of “killer robots”, presumably because compared to autonomous <em>offense</em>, defense is inherently more controllable and predictable in effect.</p>

<p>Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the fear to attack. And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision making process which rules out human meddling, the doomsday machine is terrifying. It’s simple to understand. And completely credible, and convincing… When you merely wish to bury bombs, there is no limit to the size. After that they are connected to a gigantic complex of computers. Now then, a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances, under which the bombs are to be exploded, is programmed into a tape memory bank.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove">Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</a> (1964)</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the following technological factors of nuclear weapons determined the grand nuclear strategy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First-strike nuclear offense is impossible to defend against. Some bombs will get through all defense.</li>
<li>Nuclear weapon is so much more powerful than non-nuclear weapons, that the only proportionate deterrence to a nuclear attack is another nuclear attack.</li>
<li>First-strike capability is indistinguishable from second-strike capability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of (1) and (2), the only way to deter a nuclear first-strike was to threaten a nuclear second-strike. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">MAD</a> nuclear deterrence doctrine. Because deterrence requires enough bombs to survive a first-strike, both sides would rather build up more second-strike bombs than the other side’s first-strike bombs. Because of (3), there aren’t “second-strike bombs” vs “first-strike bombs”, only bombs. Therefore, we have a positive feedback loop where both sides aim to have more bombs than the other – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race">nuclear arms race</a>. Because having too many bombs increases the chance of accidents, both sides are motivated to slow down the race. Thus the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty">ABM Treaty</a>, where both sides agree to <em>not</em> build many missile defense systems! This paradoxical treaty was designed to make both sides <em>more</em> vulnerable to second-strike, meaning that less bombs are needed to ensure second-strike capability.</p>
<p>Both sides’ nuclear technology went through several iterations, with increasing second-strike capability, and ended up with the “nuclear triad” of bombers that stay in the air 24/7, submarines hidden under the sea, and ICBMs hardened inside silos. Each of the three has different tradeoffs, necessitating all three to be maintained.</p>
<p>Of course, even if the triad survives the first-strike, it is no good if they won’t activate. The command center might be destroyed. The communication lines might be cut. The soldiers might refuse to launch based on their own conscience. All these dangers lead to the pressure to automate second-strike. The pinnacle of this logic was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile">Supersonic Low Altitude Missile (SLAM)</a>, a cruise missile powered by a nuclear engine. The nuclear engine is like a fission nuclear reactor in nuclear power plants, except that the fission power does not boil water, but heat up air, which expands and shoots out from the tail of the missile, allowing it to fly at Mach 3.</p>
<p>Despite having no GPS (it was the 1960s!), because the SLAM would fly <span class="math inline">\(\sim 200 \;\mathrm{m}\)</span> above ground, it could navigate itself by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERCOM">terrain contour matching</a>: It compares a height-scan of the local terrain against a stored copy of the terrain. Even after dropping all its nuclear warheads, it can remain airborne for weeks, destroying the ground with sonic booms as overkill. The project was shelved in 1964, apparently considered too destabilizing, and they settled for just drilling the nuclear launch routines into the missileers until they work like robots that would not hesitate to execute the launch command.</p>

<p>In the movie <em>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</em> (1964), nuclear deterrence was taken to its logical end point. In the movie, the Soviet Union built a “doomsday machine”, which is a Cobalt bomb that when exploded, makes enough fallout to render the entire earth uninhabitable for a century. This was then connected to sensors around the Soviet Union, so that any nuclear attack automatically triggers it. Finally, the machine triggers if it detects attempts to un-trigger it, thus closing the logic loop and making it a fully automatic deterrence machine.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Astrophysicists, measuring the motion of galaxies, notice that the stars are rotating too fast. There is not enough matter to tether them, and they ought to fly out into the intergalactic emptiness. To solve this problem, they proposed “dark matter”, unknown matter that provides the missing gravitational force, and physicists ever since had been searching them.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes when you read through a field of study, you notice that the arguments seem to rotate around some kind of unspoken assumption that you might see if you just take all the books and throw them to the ground, so that they are all opened at random places.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-symbolic-hypothesis">The Symbolic Hypothesis</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/docs/posts/1975-herbert-simon-allen-newell/">their Turing award lecture of 1975</a>, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon gave a definitive statement of the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis for AI, which they had labored under, first unconsciously but then consciously, since the early 1950s.</p>
<p>They began by some examples of “qualitative structure” in science, which do not deal with numbers, but with symbols. For example, a basic statement of cell theory – “organisms are made of little cells that are mostly alike” – doesn’t contain a single number, yet it has great significance. Such non-numerical discrete statements are made of “symbols”, and they stated their <strong>Physical Symbol System Hypothesis</strong> (PSSH):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where a physical symbol system is essentially a machine that can be built in our physical world, and that manipulates with symbols. As an example, a digital computer running a LISP interpreter is a physical symbol system. We can attach cameras and wheels to the computer, so that the camera sends into the interpreter a symbolic representation of what it sees, and the wheels receives symbolic commands for motion. This is basically a robot according to the PSSH.</p>
<p>They also gave a <strong>Heuristic Search Hypothesis</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A physical symbol system exercises its intelligence in problem solving by search-that is, by generating and progressively modifying symbol structures until it produces a solution structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is not said is equally revealing. In the lecture, there were over 100 mentions of the word “search”, but the only statement about learning is… a mention of Plato’s theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)">anamnesis</a>! For them, a symbolic system starts out already with a solution generator and a solution tester, and problem-solving is nothing but heuristically searching over the generated solutions until one passes the tester. Indeed, in their telling, AI research is just search, not learning.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… During the first decade or so of artificial intelligence research, the study of problem solving was almost synonymous with the study of search processes. From our characterization of problems and problem solving, it is easy to see why this was so. In fact, it might be asked whether it could be otherwise. … There is no mystery where the information that guided the search came from. We need not follow Plato in endowing the symbol system with a previous existence in which it already knew the solution. A moderately sophisticated generator-test system did the trick without invoking reincarnation.</p>

<p>There was a persistent legend about a certain psychologist, that he educated his own children with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">skinner boxes</a>. While just a legend, the real B. F. Skinner did have a philosophy as radical as the legend suggests.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Skinner dominated behaviorism, which dominated American psychology. In short, behaviorism models animal behavior as stimulus-response reflexes, which can be understood as parameterized functions <span class="math inline">\(a_\theta(o)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> stands for the observational stimulus, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> the internal parameters of the animal, and <span class="math inline">\(a_\theta(o)\)</span> the response action. The parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a function of the previous history of stimuli and reward/punishments: <span class="math inline">\((o_0, a_0, r_0, o_1, a_1, r_1, \dots)\)</span>. The set up is the same as modern reinforcement learning (RL).</p>
<p>The great thing about skinner boxes is that they are standardized to be lightproof, soundproof, and whatever-proof, thus controlling for all confounding variables. Before skinner boxes, mouse experiments were full of confounding variables, and had a kind of replication crisis in the 1930s. With the skinner box, the degrees of rat freedom are minimized, turning rats into standardized systems. This finally allowed measurable progress, allowing the breakout success of behaviorism in the 1950s.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn22"><p><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://gwern.net/maze">Feynman told of the following maze-running rat legend</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No.&nbsp;The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before. The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and, still the rats could tell. He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.</p>
</blockquote>
</div></div><p>Skinner’s ambitions went far beyond rats. In 1957, he published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_Behavior"><em>Verbal Behavior</em></a>, in which he explained human language as stimulus-response networks, built up piece by piece during child development. To give an example, when one searches for a book with a title “Verbal Behavior”, one would say “Verbal Behavior, Verbal Behavior, Verbal Behavior…” (a “self-echoic”) while the eye scans the shelf. When the visual stimulus matches the verbal stimulus, the “grab book” action is triggered (a “tact”). The touch of the hand with the book then stops self-echoic behavior. In Skinner’s terms, this verbal behavior is a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclitic">descriptive autoclitic</a>”.</p>
<p>He was at his most radical in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Freedom_and_Dignity"><em>Beyond Freedom and Dignity</em> (1971)</a>, which essentially argued that human society will be reorganized according to behaviorist principles. Instead of the indirect and unreliable behavior control using verbal moral judgment, a society would use more direct operant conditioning methods that are experimentally proven by behaviorist psychologists.</p>
<p>Though behaviorism has remained alive and well to this day, linguistics took a sudden turn around 1960 thanks to Noam Chomsky. According to legend, Chomsky wrote a review of <em>Verbal Behavior</em> in 1959, in which he soundly routed behaviorist linguistics <span class="citation" data-cites="chomskyReviewSkinnersVerbal1959">(<a href="#ref-chomskyReviewSkinnersVerbal1959" role="doc-biblioref">Chomsky 1959</a>)</span>. The truth is more complicated, since Chomsky also wrote several other famous works like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures"><em>Syntactic Structures</em> (1957)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Theory_of_Syntax"><em>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax</em> (1967)</a>, and the foundational papers on formal grammar like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>Chomsky argued that there are two ways of doing research in psychology and linguistics: “empiricism” and “rationalism”. Skinner’s book was the best example of empiricism, and since Skinner’s book is wrong, the book becomes a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of empiricism. Instead, one must turn back to rationalist psychology and linguistics.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I had intended this review not specifically as a criticism of Skinner’s speculations regarding language, but rather as a more general critique of behaviorist (I would now prefer to say “empiricist”) speculation as to the nature of higher mental processes… I do not, in other words, see any way in which his proposals can be substantially improved within the general framework of behaviorist or neobehaviorist, or, more generally, empiricist ideas that has dominated much of modern linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. The conclusion that I hoped to establish in the review, by discussing these speculations in their most explicit and detailed form, was that the general point of view was largely mythology, and that its widespread acceptance is not the result of empirical support, persuasive reasoning, or the absence of a plausible alternative.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What is wrong with empiricism? Fundamentally, Chomsky’s argument is based on two properties that every human language has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity: There exists infinitely many grammatical sentences, and infinitely many ungrammatical sentences.</li>
<li>Generativity: Humans can agree with each other whether a never-before-seen sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plato observed that, though we have only seen imperfect geometric shapes, we have a concept of perfect circles, triangles and so on. He inferred from this that we are born with the ideal concepts within us, to be matched against imperfect shapes out there. Similarly, Chomsky argued that we are born with the ideal Universal Grammar within us, to be matched against the language observations in the world.</p>
<p>For example, in the Universal Grammar, there is a setting called “subject-verb-object order”, with 6 possible values: SVO, SOV, …, OVS. An infant need only observe a few dozen sentences to fix this setting. Chomsky extended this project to all of natural language grammar.</p>
<p>Chomsky made a multi-pronged rejection of empiricism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poverty of stimulus: Humans learn language with just a few years of language instruction. This is impossible if they “start from scratch”. Thus, they have a lot of inborn grammar.</li>
<li>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously: Because there are many meaningless but grammatical sentences, grammar is independent of meaning. Thus, grammar, unlike meaning, can be a small closed system that fits inside a brain at birth.</li>
<li>Probability is meaningless: A sentence is either grammatical or not. THere is no in-between. Therefore it is meaningless to talk about the “probability of a sentence” like the empiricists.</li>
<li>Impersonal abstraction: Real humans can make mistakes, but language itself makes no mistake. A tired human might say “Ideas sleep furiously.” is ungrammatical 10% of the times, but the English language <em>itself</em> would always say it is grammatical. Thus, the probabilities measured from real human behavior is meaningless for theoretical linguistics.</li>
<li>Competence, not performance: Even if an empirical model of language, like the HMM, works 99% of the times, a single counterexample disproves it. To work “most of the times” is capacity. To work all the time is adequacy. Linguistic science is about adequacy, and capacity is sufficient only for engineering. Competence either/or, while performance is usually/rarely. Linguistics is about competence, and performance is left for the psychologists and engineers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 60 years afterwards have been one long struggle against empiricism along these lines. For example, he had repeatedly simplified the Universal Grammar down to the minimalist core, so that it could possibly fit inside a single gene that appeared once in the evolution of humans, “switching on” language for humans and no other species. And by “60 years”, I meant it. He was nothing if not consistent:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Evidently, one’s ability to produce and recognize grammatical utterances is not based on notions of statistical approximation and the like… a structural analysis cannot be understood as a schematic summary developed by sharpening the blurred edges in the full statistical picture… that grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning, and that probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure.</p>

<p>Knowing his framework, we understand why he rejected both statistical models like n-grams or neural models like GPT-3 as “zero” in terms of advancing theoretical linguistics. They are empirically constructed: thousands of researchers were just trying things out, and eventually they started to work. Worse, both kinds of models assign <em>nothing but</em> probabilities to sentences!</p>
<p>When engaging with the modern Chomskyans (they still exist!), one notices a strategic ambiguity on the edge of competence vs performance. On one hand, Chomsky has simply defined scientific linguistics to be the study of language and competence. That is, he made the following kind of definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language is a kind of mathematical object with associated transformations of it (such as the transformation that converts a verb to a past tense).</li>
<li>A person or a computer, has competence for a language iff it can perform the correct transformations on a language object.</li>
<li>Scientific linguistics is the study of languages, and how competence is implemented in various algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chomsky’s definition deliberately draws a line between competence and performance. However, this line immediately gets crossed, because even immortals cannot subsist on only aether. Chomskyan scientific linguistics, to be scientific, still needs to gather empirical data and predict outcomes of empirical experiments, and thus was Chomsky able to influence AI developments, by an implicit empirical claim: “Building an AI like a generative grammar is how you get good empirical performance.”</p>
<p>Chomskyans have long engaged with AI. There have been Chomskyan language models, but the idea is very different. When Chomskyans do a language model, it is a scientific experiment to test a linguistic theory. If a program written according to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(linguistics)">merge-grammar</a> of verbs can convert verbs to the past tense correctly (on a small example of 200 verbs), then that shows merge-grammar theory of verbs is a good theory. The n-gram language model is <em>trivially</em> disproven,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> so even if an n-gram model achieves better performance according to the entropy, all a Chomskyan needs to do is point at that theorem, and say, “That’s not science, that’s engineering.”.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn23"><p><sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The short explanation: English is not a regular language, so it can’t be modeled by a Markov chain.</p>
<p>The slightly longer explanation: English has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_embedding">center embedding</a>, so English cannot be parsed by any finite state machine, while n-gram models are probabilistic finite state machines (aka Markov chains). Now prove the following theorem: If a language is not parsable by a finite state machine, then for any Markov model for the language, there exists sentences <span class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \dots\)</span> in the language, such that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{n \to \infty} Pr(s_n) = 0\)</span>. To show this, prove that there exists arbitrarily long sentences that are so long that the Markov chain “forgets where it was”.

Indeed, they had been much less circumspect compared to Chomsky, since they had been predicting the imminent <em>empirical</em> failure of large models at performance because of their lack of <em>rational</em> competence.</p></div></div><p>Now, when Chomsky took a look at GPT-4, all he saw was another “success as approximating unanalyzed data”, a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of empiricism at the price of $100 million.

<p>The dominance of the Symbolic Hypothesis was never complete. There were often objections to it.</p>
<p>In 1972, Hubert Dreyfus raised a fuss with a book <em>What Computers Can’t Do: The Limits of Artificial Intelligence</em>. Unfortunately, his work was based on the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger, who wrote like <em>real and genuine</em> philosophers,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> so I just resorted to checking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus%27s_views_on_artificial_intelligence">his Wikipedia article</a>. From what I gathered, his argument was that the Symbolic Hypothesis is flawed in the sense that it is too “closed”.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn25"><p><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Edward Feigenbaum’s reaction is representative of most AI scientists:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>With that, I managed to understand Dreyfus’ argument clearly. His main point is that logical AI, exemplified by Simon and Newell’s GPS, cannot reach human-level reasoning, because logical AI cannot perform 3 fundamental human forms of information processing: fringe consciousness, essence/accident discrimination, and ambiguity tolerance. These require brain-like computers to perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fringe consciousness: Chess players do not analyze positions like the GPS. Whereas the GPS performs a unified heuristic search, chess players seem to unconsciously scan a large number of positions, making some variations seem salient, which they then consciously “count out”. The unconscious scanning is <em>not</em> search, since otherwise why not perform unconscious search all the way to the finish line? The conscious “counting out” is captured by the GPS, but the unconscious “zeroing in” is not.</li>
<li>Essence/accident discrimination: Even on simple, well-defined problems like cryptogram puzzles, the GPS and humans reason very differently. Humans can simplify problems with symmetry like “for basically the same reason…”, and backtrack based on an understanding of the overall problem structure. Even Simon and Newell have labelled their human subjects’ reasoning steps as either “essential” or “inessential”. GPS solves a problem like humans do only if the programmers have so helpfully pre-structured the problem with the essential features. These all show that human reasoning distinguishes some as essential while others as accidental, and focuses their conscious problem solving over the essential features, something GPS cannot do.</li>
<li>Ambiguity tolerance: So far, machine translation and language understanding research had only worked on highly artificial and restricted domains, since none of them could handle the ambiguity in natural language. Humans can handle this massive ambiguity because humans process language not according to precise rules, but by unconscious processing that statistically combines context, goals, and background knowledge, and produces <em>precise enough</em> outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From our vantage point, chess ended up falling to the heuristic search of DeepBlue, but Go did require combining “fringe consciousness” with heuristic search in the CNN+MCTS architecture of AlphaGo. The three forms of information processing he singled out as requiring brain-like computing turned out to be precisely where neural networks achieved breakout success. Of course, the logical AI camp would not go down without a fight, and with “Parallel Distributed Processing” – the revival of neural networks in 1980s – there would be a bitter dispute, centered around, of all things, how to form the past tense of English verbs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn26"><p><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Having checked out his latest writing, we regret to inform thee that he was a blind cat that caught a mice by an accidental swipe of the paw, but then starved to death by doing it again and again.

<p>The commonsense knowledge problem, which as Minsky says, stopped AI in the early 70ies, has never been solved; except for Lenat it has just been ignored. Yet Chalmers assumes incremental progress and confidently asserts that “Given the way that computer technology always advances, it is natural enough to think that once there is AI, AI? will be just around the corner.” But that just is the first step fallacy. AI is always just round the corner but, as Chalmers himself admits, never succeeds in turning that corner. There is, in fact, <em>no reason to think that we are making progress towards AI or, indeed, that AI is even possible, in which case claiming incremental progress towards it would make no sense.</em></p>

</div></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter">Douglas Hofstadter</a> raised a similar objection, but from within the logical AI tradition. His essential point was that logical AI, as conceived by Simon and Newell, is a closed system. For example, a chess computer might play a perfect chess even when the room is on fire. The concept of fire, or indeed anything that is beyond the mathematical strucure of chess, does not feature in the computer’s symbolic universe, and so it does not exist for the computer.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Whereas Dreyfus argued that intelligence is open by the “cotton candy” of phenomenology, sieging the head from the outside in, Hofstadter used the Gödel incompleteness theorems to break the head open, from the inside out.</p>
<p>The rough idea is that any symbolic system that is powerful enough would be incomplete, and furthermore, would “reflect” its own incompleteness. The incompleteness theorems state that in any sufficiently powerful formal system, there are statements that are true about the system that cannot be proven within the system. For example, let <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> be the logical system of Peano arithmetics, then by the incompleteness theorems, there are sentences like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosser%27s_trick">Rosser’s sentence</a>, or “PA is consistent”, which are <em>provably unprovable</em> assuming PA is consistent.</p>

<p>In the context of AI, this means that a symbolic system, no matter how complex, will always have limitations in representing and reasoning about the world, even if the world is but itself. We need not assume there is an “outside”. The symbolic system, even when floating in a mathematical vacuum, creates its own outside.</p>
<p>His solution was to add in some “strange loops”, which would both create general intelligence and create consciousness in one fell swoop. These strange loops are hierarchical structures where crossing levels leads back to the starting point. In the context of AI, Hofstadter proposed that implementing strange loops within a symbolic system would allow the system to refer to itself and its own structure, potentially leading to self-awareness and general intelligence. This self-referential capability would enable the system to overcome the limitations imposed by the incompleteness theorems and exhibit more flexible and human-like intelligence.</p>
<p>Hofstadter was a far better writer than Dreyfus, and his 1979 book <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> was a popular hit among both the common people and the computer scientists. Despite this, the trajectory of AI did not go as he expected.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-learning-theory">Statistical learning theory</h3>
<p>In the 1960s, Vladimir Vapnik was working on a Ph.D.&nbsp;in statistics, but due to multiple political problems, he was forced to withdraw the thesis and republish it as a book, in which he laid out his vision of statistical learning theory.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>From the KGB’s point of view I was a wrong person to obtain the doctoral level: I was not a member of the Communist Party, I was Jewish, my PhD adviser, Alexander Lerner, had applied for immigration to Israel and became a “refusenik,” some of my friends were dissidents, and so on… The main message that I tried to deliver in the book was that classical statistics could not overcome the curse of dimensionality but the new approach could. I devoted three chapters of the book to different classical approaches and demonstrated that none of them could overcome the curse of dimensionality. Only after that did I describe the new theory.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="vapnikEstimationDependencesBased2006">(<a href="#ref-vapnikEstimationDependencesBased2006" role="doc-biblioref">Vapnik 2006</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Vapnik’s theory is to on the one hand, minimize the training loss (“empirical risk minimization”) by any statistical model, but on the other hand, avoid overfitting by controlling capacity (“VC dimension”) of the model. This was a radical departure from the previous kind of “classical statistics”, which, while not Chomskyan, was very close in spirit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<li><p>There is a group of philosophers who believe that the results of scientific discovery are the real laws that exist in nature. These philosophers are called the realists.</p></li>
<li><p>There is another group of philosophers who believe the laws that are discovered by scientists are just an instrument to make a good prediction. The discovered laws can be very different from the ones that exist in Nature. These philosophers are called the instrumentalists.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The two types of approximations defined by classical discriminant analysis (using the generative model of data) and by statistical learning theory (using the function that explains the data best) reflect the positions of realists and instrumentalists in our simple model of the philosophy of generalization, the pattern recognition model. Later we will see that the position of philosophical instrumentalism played a crucial role in the success that pattern recognition technology has achieved.</p>
<p>[vapnikEstimationDependencesBased2006, page 415]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vapnik’s books were chock-full of philosophical musings, now rarely read. Leo Breiman’s philosophical musings, however, has remained famous. As a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures">C. P. Snow’s “Two Cultures” lecture of 1959</a>, Breiman wrote <span class="citation" data-cites="breimanStatisticalModelingTwo2001">(<a href="#ref-breimanStatisticalModelingTwo2001" role="doc-biblioref">Breiman 2001</a>)</span> to contrast the “data modeling culture” with the “algorithmic modeling culture”.</p>
<p>The data modeling culture first constructs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model">generative model</a> of the data with a few parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, then construct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator">ways to estimate</a> <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> from data, with provable guarantees. This culture includes both the frequestists and the Bayesians.</p>
<p>On the plus side, a generative model with a few parameters is easy to interpret. On the minus side, if the statistician were to interpret parameters subsequently,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> then the parameters had better mean something real, which requires the model to be close to reality. That is, the price for interpretability is eternal vigilance (against model misspecification).</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn28"><p><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;One can easily check this by opening a journal in economics or medicine and look at the “results” section of some papers. There one would find parameters decorated with error bars, followed by policy recommendations, such as “Since <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{6} &gt; 0\)</span> with statistical significance, we conclude that elevating melatonin has a positive impact…”. If <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in this imaginary example is used in a data model like <span class="math inline">\(y = \sum_i \theta_i x_i + \epsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is noise, then for the sake of this imaginary author, the real biological response of the human had better be sufficiently linear to <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \dots\)</span>, at least for those <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> within the therapeutic range.</p></div></div><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This enterprise has at its heart the belief that a statistician, by imagination and by looking at the data, can invent a reasonably good parametric class of models for a complex mechanism devised by nature… If the model is a poor emulation of nature, the conclusions may be wrong. These truisms have often been ignored in the enthusiasm for fitting data models. A few decades ago, the commitment to data models was such that even simple precautions such as residual analysis or goodness-of-fit tests were not used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithmic modeling culture in contrast is very empirical – if it works on the training set, and if statistical learning theory predicts that its train-test gap is low (“capacity control” again), then it works. Data modeling culture was stuck with generative models, unable to use tools that work despite not interpretable as generative models – random forests, boosting, bagging, neural networks, all the latest algorithms popping up in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Among the many replies to this bombshell of an editorial, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cox_(statistician)">David Cox</a> went directly for the philosophical:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Professor Breiman takes a rather defeatist attitude toward attempts to formulate underlying processes; is this not to reject the base of much scientific progress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Efron">Bradley Efron</a> was like “hopefully you are just playing devil’s advocate”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A third front seems to have been opened in the long-running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_statistics#Bayesian_inference_versus_frequentist_inference">frequentist-Bayesian wars</a> by the advocates of algorithmic prediction, who don’t really believe in any inferential school… The whole point of science is to open up black boxes, understand their insides, and build better boxes for the purposes of mankind. Leo himself is a notably successful scientist, so we can hope that the present paper was written more as an advocacy device than as the confessions of a born-again black boxist.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connectionism-the-past-tense-debate-and-whatever">Connectionism, the past tense debate, and whatever</h3>
<p>“Connectionism” is a word you don’t see much nowadays, but it was a big word back in the 1980s. It is hard to pin down, but if I summarize it, it is the result of philosophers in the 1980s noticing how researchers were trying neural networks on problems that had defied logical AI approaches, and somehow achieved state of the art, way past expectations. They say, “Weird! How is it possible for neural networks, written by people not having a deep knowledge of the problem domain, using such simplistic features, to work better than the best logical AI? I must philosophize this at once!”</p>
<p>Two clear camps immediately formed. On one side were the connectionists with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Churchland">Paul Churchland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Churchland">Patricia Churchland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smolensky">Paul Smolensky</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Elman">Jeffrey Elman</a>. On the other side were the cognitivists (or perhaps the rationalists) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Fodor">Jerry Fodor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenon_Pylyshyn">Zenon Pylyshyn</a>, with the spirit of Noam Chomsky always present in the background.</p>
<p>Chapter 18 of <em>Parallel Distributed Processing</em> vol.&nbsp;2 bore the unassuming title “On learning the past tenses of verbs in English” <span class="citation" data-cites="rumelhartLearningTensesEnglish1986">(<a href="#ref-rumelhartLearningTensesEnglish1986" role="doc-biblioref">Rumelhart and McClelland 1986</a>)</span>.

<span id="cb11-26"><a href="#cb11-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>During WWII, the science of communication and control took on a life-and-death importance. The mathematically perfect Enigma forced Allied mathematicians to turn their art of code into the science of information, so as to extract every last bit of information leaked out from the unknown enemy who was less than mathematically perfect, who made mistakes, who stuttered with verbal tics like <span class="in">`WETTER`</span> or <span class="in">`KEINE BESONDEREN EREIGNISSE`</span>. On two sides of the Atlantic, Alan Turing of computer science, and Claude Shannon of information theory, fought in this information warfare.</span>
<span id="cb11-27"><a href="#cb11-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-28"><a href="#cb11-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Before the war, some feared that the bombers would finally be the ultimate weapon, as a fleet of <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">them will always get through</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_bomber_will_always_get_through)</span>. Bombing was becoming a cyborg activity. The bombers were flying so high and so fast, the bombardiers needed <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">intricate bombsights</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norden_bombsight)</span> filled with mechanical calculators, just to calculate the correct time to drop the bombs.</span>
<span id="cb11-29"><a href="#cb11-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-30"><a href="#cb11-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>But the bombers would not go through after all, as radar screens and flak cannons raised invisible walls in the sky, and the anti-aircraft fire became another cyborg activity. Norbert Wiener developed his control theory in the context of anti-aircraft fire and radar screening. He thought of both as a form of deadly communication. A radar speaks to the aircraft, "Who and where are you?" Despite itself, the aircraft must answer. The radar's job is to speak clearly with the right ping and listen carefully with the right filter. In this context, he developed the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Wiener filter</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter)</span>.</span>
<span id="cb11-31"><a href="#cb11-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-32"><a href="#cb11-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Anti-aircraft (AA) seems even less like a deadly communication, yet Wiener made it work. To shoot down an aircraft, one must predict where it will be a few seconds into the future, since that is how long bullets take to fly that high. The AA looks to the sky and asks, "Where are you going?". Despite itself, the aircraft speaks with where it had been in the past few seconds, as if writing a cursive word in the sky. The AA reads and understands this writing, and act accordingly. The past is a code for the future, like the Enigma is a code for the plaintext. <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@yeangFilteringNoiseAntiaircraft2023</span><span class="co">]</span></span>

<span id="cb11-34"><a href="#cb11-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>If the soldiers are always preparing to fight the previous war, the same seems true for some mathematicians. Wiener and his collaborator, Warren Weaver, decided to tackle the problem of machine translation with the same tools they developed for war. If information theory helps with breaking the Enigma code, would it not also help with breaking the language codes?</span>

<span id="cb11-40"><a href="#cb11-40" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>During the 1950s, electronic computers were mainly understood and used as tools for real-valued calculations, such as simulating nuclear explosions, the aerodynamics of ballistic missiles, macroeconomic planning, and other important real-valued functions that are necessary to safeguard freedom. However, there was already early attempts at using computers for symbolic calculations.</span>

<span id="cb11-42"><a href="#cb11-42" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In a sense, this was quite old. Whereas Charles Babbage designed his computer as an arithmetic mill to grind out numerical tables, Ada Lovelace speculated that computers can grind out symbolic music too, as long as music and its transformation rules are encoded into integers.</span>

As we see, each Russian word has 1 or 2 possible English translations. The three <span class="in">`Code`</span>s are essentially grammar categories. As an example, the suffix <span class="in">`-a`</span> is coded as <span class="in">`(-a, of, , 131, 222, 25)`</span>, while the word stem <span class="in">`ugl-`</span> is coded as <span class="in">`(ugl-, coal, angle, 121, ***, 25)`</span>.</span>

<span id="cb11-59"><a href="#cb11-59" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The dictionary contains just 250 lexical items (stems and endings). Its grammar has just 6 rules.

The word-order switch is necessary since Russian puts prepositions as word suffixes.

However, it was a common belief that electronic computers, like the IBM 701, were designed for numerical computation, something that is more difficult than natural language processing. As such, a machine translator needed not faster computers, but more data. Yet among the general optimism, there was a disquieting note:</span>

I didn't read the spaghetti code in detail, but it seems to me that it first parses the input sequence into words and sub-words, then it starts from left to right, for each word/sub-word, find the rule that applies to it. Executing the rule would pick an English translation for that word/sub-word, and either switch that fragment of translation with the previous fragment, or not. There are 6 rules, of which I just copy one, since the others look similarly boring:</span>

<span id="cb11-150"><a href="#cb11-150" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Georgetown--IBM demo worked. The CIA started funding MT research at Georgetown University (eventually up to \$1,500,000), and other MT groups sprang up in America, Europe, and the Soviet Union. In general, their approaches could be divided into three parts: word-for-word, syntax, and eclectic.</span>
<span id="cb11-151"><a href="#cb11-151" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-152"><a href="#cb11-152" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The idea of word-for-word translation is essentially a direct scale-up of the Georgetown--IBM demo, just with a much bigger dictionary and a few more local word-reordering rules. True, there are some ambiguities like "The vodka was good, but the meat was rotten.", but we can just pick the most likely translation, or translate a multi-word Russian phrase directly to a multi-word English phrase, etc. Erwin Reifler exemplified the "solved by lexicography" approach:</span>
<span id="cb11-153"><a href="#cb11-153" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-154"><a href="#cb11-154" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; Papers on MT are nowadays heavily weighted on the side of the development of structural linguistic procedures for the solution of MT problems, and very rightly so. But many of these problems can be solved by lexicography... in certain types of cases of higher frequency it is possible to solve grammatical and non-grammatical problems by lexicography and lexicographical procedures alone--that is, without the necessity of logical procedures and logical machine operations. Since our sponsors had asked us to concentrate, at least during the initial phases of our project, on the elaboration of a bilingual lexicon, we decided to try to achieve an optimum of lexicography which would solve as many of our bilingual problems as possible. The results of this lexicographical work were... almost 170,000 MT-operational Russian-English entries.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-162"><a href="#cb11-162" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>At MIT under Victor Yngve, the research agenda was fully based on syntax. A sentence in the source language is parsed into a syntax tree, then the syntax tree is transformed by some rotation, grafting, cutting, and pasting, and finally the leaf-words are substituted into the target language. To see an example use of this, consider the German sentence »Hans kommt heute abend an.«, which translates to "Hans arrives this evening".. Here, "arrives" corresponds to »kommt ... an«, and the distance between the two pieces of the verb can be arbitrarily long, thus no local transformation rule would work. However, though this is similar in spirit to Chomskyan linguistics, Chomsky was only briefly in the group, and his generative grammar was not used.</span>

The post-war flood of governmental funds was slowing as the optimistic "Science, the Endless Frontier" lost its shine. There were much bigger projects to do, like sending 2 men to the moon or 3 million to Vietnam. The general atmosphere was subdued.

It was all well and good if MT could eventually reach human level performance in a few centuries, or if MT research could *right now* inform the science of linguistics and assist the universe's ceaseless striving to rationally know itself, but let us never confuse the universal with the here and now.</span>

Most of the report is not on whether MT is possible, but on the economics of translating technical documents from Russian to English, and whether MT would be economically good enough for this within the next few years. For example, it calculated that since a machine-translated document takes longer to read, if a document were to be read by more than 20 people, human translation is more economical. What the report says about MT itself is fairly brief:</span>

In this context, there has been no machine translation of general scientific text, and none is in immediate prospect. The contention that there has been no machine translation of general scientific text is supported by the fact that when, after 8 years of work, the Georgetown University MT project tried to produce useful output in 1962, they had to resort to postediting. The postedited translation took slightly longer to do and was more expensive than conventional human translation.</span></span>

MT research continued, but with minimal government funding, and it often continued as a kind of computational study in service of basic research in linguistics. They typically followed the approach of Vauquois, that is, to take a sentence from one language, and parse it into higher and higher levels of abstraction, reaching an "interlingua" stage that is fully language-independent, then move back down again until one lands safely in the other language. It reminds me of taking an airplane across an ocean.</span>

Well, not exactly, but during the period of 1976--1986, a group of researchers in IBM managed to produce speech recognition systems better than ever before, by "firing the linguists", and returning to the information-theoretic approach that Shannon and Weaver had back in the 1950s. Armed with compute, data, and a disregard for linguistic science, they got it to work, and in 1986, they decided to try the same trick, but this time with MT.</span>

It has become popular once again to focus on high-level natural language constraints in order to reduce the search space. But this time, n-gram methods have become the methods of choice because they seem to work better than the alternatives, at least when the search space is measured in terms of entropy. Ideally, we might hope that someday parsers might reduce entropy beyond that of n-grams, but right now, parsers seem to be more useful for other tasks such as understanding who did what to whom, and less useful for predicting what the speaker is likely to say.</span></span>

The information theoretic approach to MT may fail for reasons advanced by Chomsky and others in the 1950s.

<span id="cb11-396"><a href="#cb11-396" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The machine first uses a filter bank to featurize the input sound. Pairs of outputs from the filter bank are then multiplied to measure how likely the sound is a phoneme. For example, the outputs from 200 Hz and 320 Hz are multiplied together, and that measures how likely the sound is "m", because the two principal frequencies of "m" are close to 200 Hz and 320 Hz. Finally, a computer selects the most likely phoneme, based on the multiplied results and a simple statistical model of how likely a phoneme is to follow the previous phoneme.</span>

<span id="cb11-425"><a href="#cb11-425" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In typical generative grammar of language, you start with a <span class="in">`SENTENCE`</span>, and repeatedly rewrite it until you end up with a sentence like <span class="in">`Did you hit Tom?`</span></span>

<span id="cb11-427"><a href="#cb11-427" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here, we push this one level deeper. After a sentence is generated, you substitute each word with its standard pronunciation, resulting in a sequence like <span class="in">`dɪd/juː/hɪt/tɒm`</span>. Next, apply more rewriting rules to account for the fact that we don't pronounce a whole sentence like individual words, but always "glide two words together". For example, <span class="in">`did you`</span> would actually be pronounced like <span class="in">`dija`</span>, so we account for this with a rewriting rule <span class="in">`d/juː -&gt; jə`</span>. Similarly, the double <span class="in">`t`</span> in <span class="in">`hit Tom`</span> would be merged to a single <span class="in">`t`</span>, so we add a rewriting rule <span class="in">`t/t -&gt; t`</span>. And there is no gliding at <span class="in">`ə/h`</span>, so we add <span class="in">`əh -&gt; əh`</span>.</span>

In this example, the phoneme would be <span class="in">`...`</span> while the phone would be <span class="in">`...`</span>. This precision is too annoying to me, so instead I will just say that the "phone" is just another "phoneme", and the speaker intends to say the phoneme sequence <span class="in">`...`</span>, which the speaking cortex in the brain encodes into the phoneme sequence <span class="in">`...`</span> to save work for the throat muscles.</span>

It essentially treats language as Chomsky-nonrandom, and all the randomness comes from imperfect matching between the real feature vectors and the template feature vectors. Despite this, it out-performed other systems that did. It seems that the problem was that there was insufficient data to estimate the probabilities in a probabilistic language model.</span>

It was a towering giant with 7 levels, from "data base interface" and "phrase" all the way down to the "segment" and "parameter" and 15 knowledge sources (collection of rules) for going up and down the levels of abstraction. To handle this pandemonium of knowledge sources, it uses a "shared blackboard" architecture, so that each source can chime in about whatever is currently being interpreted. This allowed it to still work even if some sources are removed, and to improve whenever any source gets added or upgraded.</span>

They therefore placed into the group two linguists who were going to guide our progress. Both linguists were quite self-confident, sure that fast progress will be possible. For instance, when we (trained as engineers or physicists) were at a loss how to construct a language model, one of the linguists declared "I'll just write a little grammar."... After about a year of frustration the linguists left our group, returned to their basic research, and we were free to pursue our self-organized, data driven, statistical dream... mostly of engineers and physicists. Only 3 or 4 people out of 10 had any previous experience with speech. None had graduate training in that field. But several of us had a background in Information Theory and that influenced our thinking.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-617"><a href="#cb11-617" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The IBM project, compared to the others, was definitely big-data. This served them well for statistical ASR, and would soon serve them well again for statistical MT. They started with a toy model of language called "New Rayleigh", which is essentially a Markov chain model that generates sentences up to 8 words long, from a vocabulary of 250 words.<span class="ot">[^old-rayleigh]</span></span>

The back end converted these labels into a sequence of words using an artificial finite-state grammar that was so small that the finite-state machine could be written down on a single piece of paper... very often phones were simply mislabeled. The back end was designed to overcome these problems by navigating through the finite-state network, applying a complicated set of hand-tuned penalties and bonuses to the various paths in order to favor those paths where the low-level acoustics matched the high-level grammatical constraints. </span></span>

The next dataset they obtained was the "laser patent corpus", consisting of 2 million words of patent applications in laser technology, with a vocabulary size of 10,000, twice as large as the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Brown Corpus (1961)</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus)</span>.

The researchers first considered using a collection of digitized IBM manuals, but found the vocabulary to be too extensive as well as so technical that it proved "difficult to pass ... off as English." They attempted to produce their own corpus, enlisting the wife of a lab staff member to type approximately a million words of text from children's novels, but there, too, the vocabulary proved too large for their purposes. Next, the group acquired a collection of laser patent text from the US Patent Office, which was both sufficiently extensive in size and sufficiently narrow in vocabulary that they were finally able to extract a million words of running text confined to a thousand-word vocabulary. Though the laser patent corpus was considered "naturally occurring," it was in fact meticulously constructed, even before researchers discarded all sentences containing vocabulary outside of the thousand most frequently occurring words. The complete patent text had to be first "subjected to intensive hand and computerized editing": eliminating duplicates, merging spelling variations, and substituting scientific symbols and formulas. The claims sections of the patents proved especially problematic due to "highly stylized" legal language, and were ultimately excised entirely.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-632"><a href="#cb11-632" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; By the 1980s hardware improvements allowed the IBM researchers to expand their recognition vocabulary to five thousand words. They also compiled over 100 million words of data from a variety of sources, including public domain books and magazines from the American Printing House for the Blind, the records of the Amoco oil corporation, and 2.5 million words of office correspondence supplied by physicist Richard Garwin, who, with the aid of four secretaries, maintained computer-formatted duplicates of all of his correspondence. The most substantial collection in this period, however, came as a direct result of IBM's unique industry dominance: the landmark federal antitrust lawsuit filed against the company in 1969. The case, which spanned thirteen years before it was finally dismissed in 1982, included testimony from 974 witnesses with resulting transcripts that totaled over one hundred thousand pages. The operation to digitize the deposition transcripts during the trial was so prodigious that it required a staff of dedicated keypunch operators large enough to fill a facility the size of a football field in White Plains, New York, where IBM's Data Processing Division was headquartered. While the suit itself proved extremely costly for IBM, its transcript digitization efforts provided the CSR group with their largest and most robust text collection, resulting in a corpus of one hundred million words. Finally, the CSR group discovered the Hansard corpus, a collection of digitized transcripts of the Canadian Parliament official proceedings in both English and French, in the mid-1980s and incorporated an additional hundred million words from its English text into their language model.</span></span>

On the same task as the ARPA project, it reached higher accuracy, and only took 30 MIP to process 1 second of speech. <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@reddySpeechRecognitionMachine1976</span><span class="co">]</span> Though logical ASR continued with systems like Hearsay-II (1980), as the 1980s went on, none could deny the practical success of statistical ASR anymore, even if, compared to logical ASR, statistical ASR was far from linguistic theories of human speech recognition.</span>
<span id="cb11-637"><a href="#cb11-637" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-638"><a href="#cb11-638" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In the 1990s, all state of the art ASR were statistical, usually HMM-based. Such a model has multiple levels.</span>
<span id="cb11-639"><a href="#cb11-639" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-640"><a href="#cb11-640" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>At the top level, there is a Markov chain that serves as a language model, which emits individual words. This is usually an n-gram model, where $n$ is usually 3. In such a model, each node is a 3-gram. For example, the model can have state transitions like "- - what" → "- what is" → "what is the" → "is the last" → ..., and it would emit "what", "is", "the", "last", ...</span>
<span id="cb11-641"><a href="#cb11-641" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-642"><a href="#cb11-642" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This sequence of words is then converted to a sequence of phonemes, like "wɒtɪzðəlɑːst". Each phoneme, like "ɪ", corresponds to a trained Markov chain. That is, we have a Markov chain with around 3 to 5 states that emits feature vectors corresponding to a possible pronunciation of "ɪ". </span>
<span id="cb11-643"><a href="#cb11-643" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-644"><a href="#cb11-644" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We can even hand-write such a Markov chain, as an example. We would start by collecting many recordings of "ɪ", then cut these into three parts: the start, the middle, and the end. We convert each part into a feature vector: $v_0, v_1, v_2$. We give each feature vector a state in the Markov chain. A trajectory through the Markov chain would start at $v_0$, stay there for a short while, then randomly jump to $v_1$, stay there for a long while, and then randomly jump to $v_2$, stay there for a short while, and finally jump to the "END" state. We would assign the transition probability $Pr(v_2 | v_2)$ to be roughly $1-1/N$, where $N$ is the average number of 10-ms segments that it takes to pronounce the middle of "ɪ".</span>
<span id="cb11-645"><a href="#cb11-645" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-646"><a href="#cb11-646" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The above system is the basic idea. It does not handle the effect of gliding between phonemes, like how "did you" would be pronounced as "dija". The standard way to handle this was the triphone model. The triphone model accounts for how a phoneme is changed by its two neighbors. For example, in the previous example, the "ɪ" should really be pronounced in the context of "tɪz". So, we would have a Markov chain just for "tɪz", which would generate a sequence of feature vectors that corresponds to how "ɪ" would be pronounced if it appears in the context of "tɪz". Since English has about 50 phonemes, a triphone model need ~2500 Markov chains, which explains why quad-phone models, or more, had not been popular. Even if one had the appetite for it, there was not enough data to train them.</span>

<span id="cb11-648"><a href="#cb11-648" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>By late 1990s, the ASR technology stabilized around the gaussian mixture HMM <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@huangHistoricalPerspectiveSpeech2014</span><span class="co">]</span>, where the lowest level of HMM does not emit a feature vector $v$, but a <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">gaussian mixture distribution</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model)</span> $\sum_i p_i \mathcal N(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)$ of feature vectors. You can add even more epicycles upon epicycles to account for more complex features like omitting phonemes, phonotactic constraints, prosody, etc.</span>

<span id="cb11-652"><a href="#cb11-652" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Unlike in the case of MT, the collapse of logical AI in ASR was decisive. Statistical ASR completely replaced logical ASR in the 1990s, after which logical ASR was never revived. There were two reasons for this. One is the familiar scaling story of data and compute:</span>
<span id="cb11-653"><a href="#cb11-653" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-654"><a href="#cb11-654" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; As computers increased in power, ever greater tracts of the heuristic wasteland opened up for colonization by probabilistic models. As greater quantities of recorded data became available, these areas were tamed by automatic training techniques. Today... almost every aspect of most speech recognition systems is dominated by probabilistic models with parameters determined from data.</span></span>

The ARPA competitions resulted in wide-scale borrowing of techniques among labs since it was easy to see which ideas reduced errors the previous year, and the competitions were probably an important factor in the eventual spread of the HMM paradigm. </span></span>

Whilst it was obvious to everyone that this model was hopelessly impoverished, in practice it had proved almost impossible to improve on. However, in the year 2000, Fred published a paper with one of his students called "Structured language modeling for speech recognition". It sets out a principled way to incorporate linguistics into a statistical framework and as well as representing a significant step forward in language modeling, it has helped bridge the gap between speech engineers and the hitherto diverging computational linguistics community. In 2002, it received a "Best Paper" award and the citation read "for work leading to significant advances in the representation and automatic learning of syntactic structure in statistical language models". It seemed somehow fitting that 25 years after starting the movement towards statistical approaches, Fred sought to re-engage with aspects of more traditional linguistics. I hope Chomsky read the paper and enjoyed it as much as we speech technologists did.</span></span>

Even the most primitive kinds of text-to-speech was usable, and it was merely a matter of making it cheaper and less robotic-sounding.

<span id="cb11-729"><a href="#cb11-729" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In his literature review, Klatt did take notice of two upstart systems from the statistical side, one being <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">NETtalk of Sejnowski</span><span class="co">](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/backstory-of-backpropagation/index.html#terence-sejnowski)</span>, a neural network model, and another being a statistical TTS system very similar to the IBM alignment model, by the same IBM team. He brushed both off as being inferior to a logical TTS system:</span>

In some sense, this is a surprisingly good result in that so much knowledge could be embedded in a moderate number of about 25000 weights, but the performance is not nearly as accurate as that of a good set of letter-to-sound rules (performing without use of an exceptions dictionary, but with rules for recognizing common affixes)... </span><span class="sc">\[</span><span class="at">The IBM alignment</span><span class="sc">\]</span><span class="at"> approach still results in an inferior words-correct error rate compared with traditional rule systems. Even a very powerful statistical package cannot yet discover much of the underlying structure in a process as complex as natural language... given the attention that NETtalk and other neuron-like devices have received recently, it is disturbing that NETtalk does not learn training set data perfectly, appears to make generalizations suboptimally, and has an overall performance that is not acceptable for a practical system. Furthermore, it is unlikely that larger training lexicons would converge to a more acceptable performance.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-733"><a href="#cb11-733" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Indeed, though the word "rules" appears over 200 times in the review, the above dismissal was the only thing he had to say about learning-based methods. Hostility towards machine learning is a recurring feature among the Chomskyans. However, unlike the Chomskyans, Klatt was not going to be satisfied with writing toy respected the extreme complexity of a proper system of rules. And try he did:</span>

<span id="cb11-735"><a href="#cb11-735" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; The hard part of text-to-speech synthesis is to calculate a string of LPC data, or formant-synthesis parameters, not from recorded speech, but from the letters and symbols of typed text... It's possible to write a simple program for this task, which produces robotlike speech-hard to understand and unpleasant to listen to. The alternative, which only Dennis Klatt and a few others have pursued, is to invest years of effort in devising an increasingly lengthy and subtle set of rules to eliminate the robotic accent.</span></span>

Spectrograms usually feature subtle and easily changing patterns. Klatt's task has been to reduce these subtleties to rules so that a computer can routinely translate ordinary text into appropriate spectrograms. "I've drawn a lot of lines on these spectrograms, made measurements by ruler, tabulated the results, typed in numbers, and done computer analyses," says Klatt.</span></span>

It has been possible to introduce these details and to resynthesize a very good quality of voice. But to say, 'here are the rules, now I can do it for any sentence' -- that's the step that's failed miserably every time."</span></span>

The algorithm had to do something clever to deal with occlusions. In the end, a complete 3D scene populated with 3D objects is recovered.</span>

<span id="cb11-774"><a href="#cb11-774" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It is either a myth or an obvious point that the soviet union had a bad economic system. In either case, there were two Soviet Nobel laureates in economics. The first was Wassily Leontief, who saw economics not as a simple feedforward network of wheat-to-bread-to-stomach, but as a feedback network of hundreds of industries making commodities for and taking commodities from each other, as made clear in his PhD thesis *The Economy as Circular Flow* (1928).</span>

Let us divide the economy into $N$ sectors, from "agriculture" to "electricity" to "rubber". For simplicity, suppose each sector $i$ only makes one kind of commodity $x_i$ -- "agriculture" only outputs a generic kind of "food", etc. Each sector $i$, in order to create one unit of commodity $x_i$, requires some commodities $A_{1i}, A_{2i}, \dots, A_{Ni}$ as inputs. Then, if the entire economy produces $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N$, then it requires total input $Ax$, where $A$ is the demand matrix. With this we have the fundamental equation:</span>

Feeling burnt out by too much pure math, he decided to do something practical for a change of scenery, and to do something about the imminent threat of Nazi Germany. So he went to a plywoord factory in 1937, and worked on how to cut plywood sheets in such a way as to meet a specified assortment of pieces with minimum waste. And just like Dantzig, he reduced the problem to a maximization problem with linear objective and linear inequality constraints. </span>

This had the unfortunate side effect of greatly reducing the amount of scrap metal available to steel plants in the region, and Kantorovich was ordered to appear at Leningrad party headquarters for allegedly sabotaging the economy. In this instance, he was rescued by the military, which needed him for its atomic program.</span></span>

They are subordinate to the very different production relationships of a socialist society. Yet, yet, the scope for their use is actually bigger under socialism. The capitalists actually agree with you, Dr Boyarskii, that the mathematical methods we’re talking about should only be applied on the small scale, on the level of the individual firm. They have no choice: there is no larger structure, in the economy of West Germany or the United States, in which they can be set to work. They have had some success, I believe. I’m sorry to say that, since George Danzig and Tjalling Koopmans made their discoveries of “linear programming” in America during the war, the techniques have been adopted there far more eagerly, far more quickly, than in the Soviet Union. Linear programmers in the USA calculate routes for airlines, and devise the investment policies of Wall Street corporations. But we still have an opportunity before us which is closed to the capitalists. Capitalism cannot calculate an optimum for a whole economy at once. We can.

And by "detailed" I mean it.

He moves ahead, angles to the right to ease his climb up a steep dunelet, detours around a pebble, stops for a moment to exchange information with a compatriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his home. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I sketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregular, angular segments--not quite a random walk, for it has an underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal. I show the unlabeled sketch to a friend. Whose path is it? An expert skier, perhaps, slaloming down a steep and somewhat rocky slope. Or a sloop, beating upwind in a channel dotted with islands or shoals. Perhaps it is a path in a more abstract space: the course of search of a student seeking the proof of a theorem in geometry... Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.</span></span>

Later, if the root node is encountered during search, its score would be used without needing to search deeper. This allows it to increase the effective search depth over time, as it memorizes more and more positions' values. To save memory, if a board does not reappear after a maximum number of moves, it is "forgotten". The whole system managed to memorize 53,000 board positions (averaging 3.8 words each on a IBM 704)</span>

First, its evaluation function was just a linear sum over ~8000 hand-crafted features,<span class="ot">[^deep-blue-features]</span> with changeable linear weights. It actually had two evaluation functions, fast and slow. Only if the fast one already shows a clear advantage would the slow one be called. Further, the linear weights were mostly handcrafted too, except a small amount of automation:</span>
<span id="cb11-1064"><a href="#cb11-1064" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1065"><a href="#cb11-1065" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; The first tool had the goal of identifying features in the Deep Blue I evaluation function that were “noisy”, i.e., relatively insensitive to the particular weights chosen... A hill-climbing approach was used to explore selected features (or feature subsets), and those that did not converge were candidates for further hand examination... A second tool was developed with the goal of tuning evaluation function weights. This tool used a comparison training methodology to analyze weights related to pawn shelter. Training results showed that the hand-tuned weights were systematically too low, and they were increased prior to the 1997 match. There is some evidence that this change led to improved play.</span></span>

Media made much out of the 19th move of AlphaGo ("Move 37"), which the supervised learning policy network (which was supervise-trained to predict what a human would play, as according to a large dataset of human games) predicted a probability of $10^{-4}$. This was given much media attention. Something similar happened with Deep Blue vs Kasparov, game 2, when Deep Blue (White) played 36.axb5, with immediate effect:</span>

What really shook Garry Kasparov, though, was a move that the computer didn't make. On Move 36, Blue had an opportunity to shift its queen to a devastating position -- clearly the smart choice. Instead it took a subtler but superior tack that wound up to be near decisive in defeating Kasparov. After the champ resigned, he rushed back to his Plaza suite, cranked up his own computers and tried in vain to understand how a hunk of sand and metal could have understood chess so deeply. Apparently this puzzlement crossed into the realm of suspicion: the Kasparov camp was soon demanding to see Deep Blue's printouts. "It was a masterpiece by computer", said Kasparov second Michael Khodarkovsky. "We would like to understand why it was possible." (Eventually, a neutral arbiter examined the printout.) Later Kasparov blurted out his real complaint. "Suddenly \[Deep Blue\] played like a god for one moment," he said.</span></span>

Where was the AI? It wasn’t in the inference engine at all. These inference engines were, after all, pretty simple pieces of software that tested to see if the logic of the rules that the knowledge engineers wrote came up with any conclusions. The AI in complex expert systems was in the organization and representation of knowledge, the attempt to understand the domain under study, and the crystallization of what was important in the domain and how experts in the domain reasoned.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-1221"><a href="#cb11-1221" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">&gt; One obvious reason for the encouragingly high level of performance of the computer is the large amount of mass spectrometry knowledge which chemists have imparted to the program. Yet this has been one of the biggest bottlenecks in developing the program. When there was only one theory of mass spectrometry in the program, viz., the complex theory in the PREDICTOR, we were relatively insensitive to the difficulty of adding new information to the theory. Although it was a time-consuming process, it was still manageable by one programmer, working with one chemist, with most of the time spent programming as opposed to criticizing. By the time the planning phase was added to the program, it was easier to see how to shorten the task of programming by separating the chemical theory from the routines which work on the theory. The separation was by no means complete here, but it was successful enough to reduce the programming time drastically for the addition of new pieces of theory. Because the theory could be changed by changing an entry in a table, many iterations with the expert were now possible in a single one or two hour session at the console. The preponderance of time was now spent by the chemist deciding how to change the rules in the table to bring the program’s behaviour more in line with real data. The organization of the PRELIMINARY INFERENCE MAKER made the process of examining its chemical knowledge relatively simple, compared to the process of putting knowledge into the sTRUCTURE GENERATOR and PREDICTOR programs. Both of these programs are on their way to becoming ‘table driven’ in much the same way as the PRELIMINARY INFERENCE MAKER is now. (See Part 4.) Yet, re-designing the programs to allow easyadditions and changes to the chemical knowledge will not solve all ourproblems. Because mass spectroscopy is a relatively young discipline, the theory does not exist in any sort of comprehensive codified form. Part 2 will discuss some of the problems of obtaining the chemical theory that has been incorporated into the programs so far. Further, the presence of any body of knowledge in the programs brings up questions of how and where this knowledge is to be represented, stored, and referenced within the programs. Part 3 will elaborate on these issues</span></span>

Patrick Albert... pointed out the main problem afflicting the AI industry: "companies have been marketing AI technologies, and not solutions." ... the more invisible AI becomes, the more palatable it becomes to the end-user. The day ofgeneric expert system tools is probably over, Arjimand said, to be replaced by off-the-shelf applications. </span></span>

"Don’t mention AI if you want any venture capital money," Laffey warned. "Call it something else, such as advanced decision systems. These days, people come to AI almost as a last resort." Zweben’s company shared the same fate as Talarian: he had to remove or restate every mention of AI from the Red Pepper prospectus before investors would take him seriously. Despite the literally thousands of successfully deployed intelligent ap- plications, AI’s reputation continues to suffer because nobody is giving credit to the AI component. Zweben suggested wish- fully that AI companies insist on being recognized for their contribution to applications, perhaps even demanding an ‘AI inside’ label, it la Intel’s ‘Intel inside’ label on PCs.</span></span>

I want all the money I spent on it back, and every year after that, the same amount. If you're going to charge me half-a-million dollars for the prototype and you deliver it, a year later I want to know that I’ve saved half-a-million and so on.” I just don't know that this industry ever got to the level of doing those calculations for its clients.</span></span>

It combines a complete syntactic analysis of each sentence with a "heuristic understander" which uses different kinds of information about a sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information about the world in deciding what the sentence means. It is based on the belief that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can "understand" the subject it is discussing. The program is given a detailed model of the knowledge needed by a simple robot having only a hand and an eye. We can give it instructions to manipulate toy objects, interrogate it about the scene, and give it information it will use in deduction. In addition to knowing the properties of toy objects, the program has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carry them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, and asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through use of context and physical knowledge.</span></span>

But the task goes from impossible to trivial if one already knows a few things about boxes and pens, police and demonstrators, and water and teakettles. The same sort of chicken-and-egg relationship characterizes CYC and ML because learning occurs at the fringe of what one already knows. Therefore, in the early 1980s, when the rest of the world was so enthusiastic about Natural Language Understanding, Machine Learning, and AI in general, we were pessimistic. We concluded the only way out of this codependency would be to prime the pump by manually crafting a million axioms covering an appreciable fraction of the required knowledge. That knowledge would serve as a critical mass, enabling further knowledge collection through NLU and ML, beginning in the mid-1990s. Mary Shepherd and I embarked on that task in 1984, knowing we had little chance of success, but seeing no alternative but to try... we are now moving toward the transition point where NLU and ML are supported. The rest of the world is disillusioned and pessimistic about symbolic AI, but ironically, as CYC reaches closure, our hopes for NLU and ML in the next 10 years are very high.</span></span>

The roll, pitch, yaw, and altitude are maintained by negative feedback. So for example, if the missile is heading east to the set-point of yaw, a valve would open, and compressed gas would force the rudder to turn, which yaws the missile west. As soon as the vane anemometer has turned a designated number, the missile considers itself to have reached the target.

<span id="cb11-1431"><a href="#cb11-1431" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Because of (1) and (2), the only way to deter a nuclear first-strike was to threaten a nuclear second-strike. This is the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">MAD</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction)</span> nuclear deterrence doctrine. Because deterrence requires enough bombs to survive a first-strike, both sides would rather build up more second-strike bombs than the other side's first-strike bombs. Because of (3), there aren't "second-strike bombs" vs "first-strike bombs", only bombs. Therefore, we have a positive feedback loop where both sides aim to have more bombs than the other -- the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">nuclear arms race</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race)</span>. Because having too many bombs increases the chance of accidents, both sides are motivated to slow down the race. Thus the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">ABM Treaty</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty)</span>, where both sides agree to *not* build many missile defense systems! This paradoxical treaty was designed to make both sides *more* vulnerable to second-strike, meaning that less bombs are needed to ensure second-strike capability.</span>
<span id="cb11-1432"><a href="#cb11-1432" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1433"><a href="#cb11-1433" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Both sides' nuclear technology went through several iterations, with increasing second-strike capability, and ended up with the "nuclear triad" of bombers that stay in the air 24/7, submarines hidden under the sea, and ICBMs hardened inside silos. Each of the three has different tradeoffs, necessitating all three to be maintained.</span>
<span id="cb11-1434"><a href="#cb11-1434" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1435"><a href="#cb11-1435" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Of course, even if the triad survives the first-strike, it is no good if they won't activate. The command center might be destroyed. The communication lines might be cut. The soldiers might refuse to launch based on their own conscience. All these dangers lead to the pressure to automate second-strike. The pinnacle of this logic was the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supersonic Low Altitude Missile (SLAM)</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile)</span>, a cruise missile powered by a nuclear engine. The nuclear engine is like a fission nuclear reactor in nuclear power plants, except that the fission power does not boil water, but heat up air, which expands and shoots out from the tail of the missile, allowing it to fly at Mach 3.</span>

<span id="cb11-1437"><a href="#cb11-1437" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Despite having no GPS (it was the 1960s!), because the SLAM would fly $\sim 200 \;\mathrm{m}$ above ground, it could navigate itself by <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">terrain contour matching</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERCOM)</span>: It compares a height-scan of the local terrain against a stored copy of the terrain. Even after dropping all its nuclear warheads, it can remain airborne for weeks, destroying the ground with sonic booms as overkill. The project was shelved in 1964, apparently considered too destabilizing, and they settled for just drilling the nuclear launch routines into the missileers until they work like robots that would not hesitate to execute the launch command.</span>

<span id="cb11-1441"><a href="#cb11-1441" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In the movie *Dr. Strangelove* (1964), nuclear deterrence was taken to its logical end point. In the movie, the Soviet Union built a "doomsday machine", which is a Cobalt bomb that when exploded, makes enough fallout to render the entire earth uninhabitable for a century. This was then connected to sensors around the Soviet Union, so that any nuclear attack automatically triggers it. Finally, the machine triggers if it detects attempts to un-trigger it, thus closing the logic loop and making it a fully automatic deterrence machine.<span class="ot">[^dead-hand]</span></span>

Such non-numerical discrete statements are made of "symbols", and they stated their **Physical Symbol System Hypothesis** (PSSH):</span>

The parameters $\theta$ is a function of the previous history of stimuli and reward/punishments: $(o_0, a_0, r_0, o_1, a_1, r_1, \dots)$.

The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and, still the rats could tell. He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door.

<span id="cb11-1516"><a href="#cb11-1516" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Though behaviorism has remained alive and well to this day, linguistics took a sudden turn around 1960 thanks to Noam Chomsky. According to legend, Chomsky wrote a review of *Verbal Behavior* in 1959, in which he soundly routed behaviorist linguistics [@chomskyReviewSkinnersVerbal1959]. The truth is more complicated, since Chomsky also wrote several other famous works like [*Syntactic Structures* (1957)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures), [*Aspects of the Theory of Syntax* (1967)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Theory_of_Syntax), and the foundational papers on formal grammar like the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Chomsky hierarchy</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy)</span>.</span>

<span id="cb11-1518"><a href="#cb11-1518" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Chomsky argued that there are two ways of doing research in psychology and linguistics: "empiricism" and "rationalism". Skinner's book was the best example of empiricism, and since Skinner's book is wrong, the book becomes a *reductio ad absurdum* of empiricism. Instead, one must turn back to rationalist psychology and linguistics.</span>

I do not, in other words, see any way in which his proposals can be substantially improved within the general framework of behaviorist or neobehaviorist, or, more generally, empiricist ideas that has dominated much of modern linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. The conclusion that I hoped to establish in the review, by discussing these speculations in their most explicit and detailed form, was that the general point of view was largely mythology, and that its widespread acceptance is not the result of empirical support, persuasive reasoning, or the absence of a plausible alternative.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-1524"><a href="#cb11-1524" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>What is wrong with empiricism? Fundamentally, Chomsky's argument is based on two properties that every human language has:</span>
<span id="cb11-1525"><a href="#cb11-1525" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1526"><a href="#cb11-1526" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Infinity: There exists infinitely many grammatical sentences, and infinitely many ungrammatical sentences.</span>
<span id="cb11-1527"><a href="#cb11-1527" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Generativity: Humans can agree with each other whether a never-before-seen sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.</span>
<span id="cb11-1528"><a href="#cb11-1528" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1529"><a href="#cb11-1529" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Plato observed that, though we have only seen imperfect geometric shapes, we have a concept of perfect circles, triangles and so on. He inferred from this that we are born with the ideal concepts within us, to be matched against imperfect shapes out there. Similarly, Chomsky argued that we are born with the ideal Universal Grammar within us, to be matched against the language observations in the world.</span>
<span id="cb11-1530"><a href="#cb11-1530" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1531"><a href="#cb11-1531" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For example, in the Universal Grammar, there is a setting called "subject-verb-object order", with 6 possible values: SVO, SOV, ..., OVS. An infant need only observe a few dozen sentences to fix this setting. Chomsky extended this project to all of natural language grammar.</span>
<span id="cb11-1532"><a href="#cb11-1532" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1533"><a href="#cb11-1533" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Chomsky made a multi-pronged rejection of empiricism:</span>
<span id="cb11-1534"><a href="#cb11-1534" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1535"><a href="#cb11-1535" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Poverty of stimulus: Humans learn language with just a few years of language instruction. This is impossible if they "start from scratch". Thus, they have a lot of inborn grammar.</span>
<span id="cb11-1536"><a href="#cb11-1536" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously: Because there are many meaningless but grammatical sentences, grammar is independent of meaning. Thus, grammar, unlike meaning, can be a small closed system that fits inside a brain at birth.</span>
<span id="cb11-1537"><a href="#cb11-1537" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Probability is meaningless: A sentence is either grammatical or not. THere is no in-between. Therefore it is meaningless to talk about the "probability of a sentence" like the empiricists.</span>
<span id="cb11-1538"><a href="#cb11-1538" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Impersonal abstraction: Real humans can make mistakes, but language itself makes no mistake. A tired human might say "Ideas sleep furiously." is ungrammatical 10\% of the times, but the English language *itself* would always say it is grammatical. Thus, the probabilities measured from real human behavior is meaningless for theoretical linguistics.</span>
<span id="cb11-1539"><a href="#cb11-1539" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Competence, not performance: Even if an empirical model of language, like the HMM, works 99% of the times, a single counterexample disproves it. To work "most of the times" is capacity. To work all the time is adequacy. Linguistic science is about adequacy, and capacity is sufficient only for engineering. Competence either/or, while performance is usually/rarely. Linguistics is about competence, and performance is left for the psychologists and engineers.</span>

<span id="cb11-1541"><a href="#cb11-1541" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The 60 years afterwards have been one long struggle against empiricism along these lines. For example, he had repeatedly simplified the Universal Grammar down to the minimalist core, so that it could possibly fit inside a single gene that appeared once in the evolution of humans, "switching on" language for humans and no other species. And by "60 years", I meant it. He was nothing if not consistent:</span>

<span id="cb11-1561"><a href="#cb11-1561" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>When engaging with the modern Chomskyans (they still exist!), one notices a strategic ambiguity on the edge of competence vs performance. On one hand, Chomsky has simply defined scientific linguistics to be the study of language and competence. That is, he made the following kind of definition:</span>
<span id="cb11-1562"><a href="#cb11-1562" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1563"><a href="#cb11-1563" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Language is a kind of mathematical object with associated transformations of it (such as the transformation that converts a verb to a past tense).</span>
<span id="cb11-1564"><a href="#cb11-1564" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>A person or a computer, has competence for a language iff it can perform the correct transformations on a language object.</span>
<span id="cb11-1565"><a href="#cb11-1565" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Scientific linguistics is the study of languages, and how competence is implemented in various algorithms.</span>
<span id="cb11-1566"><a href="#cb11-1566" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1567"><a href="#cb11-1567" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Chomsky's definition deliberately draws a line between competence and performance. However, this line immediately gets crossed, because even immortals cannot subsist on only aether. Chomskyan scientific linguistics, to be scientific, still needs to gather empirical data and predict outcomes of empirical experiments, and thus was Chomsky able to influence AI developments, by an implicit empirical claim: "Building an AI like a generative grammar is how you get good empirical performance."</span>
<span id="cb11-1568"><a href="#cb11-1568" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1569"><a href="#cb11-1569" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Chomskyans have long engaged with AI. There have been Chomskyan language models, but the idea is very different. When Chomskyans do a language model, it is a scientific experiment to test a linguistic theory. If a program written according to a <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">merge-grammar</span><span class="co">]</span>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(linguistics)) of verbs can convert verbs to the past tense correctly (on a small example of 200 verbs), then that shows merge-grammar theory of verbs is a good theory. The n-gram language model is *trivially* disproven,<span class="ot">[^n-gram-proof]</span> so even if an n-gram model achieves better performance according to the entropy, all a Chomskyan needs to do is point at that theorem, and say, "That's not science, that's engineering.".</span>

<span id="cb11-1572"><a href="#cb11-1572" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    The short explanation: English is not a regular language, so it can't be modeled by a Markov chain.</span>

<span id="cb11-1574"><a href="#cb11-1574" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="in">    The slightly longer explanation: English has [center embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_embedding), so English cannot be parsed by any finite state machine, while n-gram models are probabilistic finite state machines (aka Markov chains). Now prove the following theorem: If a language is not parsable by a finite state machine, then for any Markov model for the language, there exists sentences $s_1, s_2, \dots$ in the language, such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} Pr(s_n) = 0$. To show this, prove that there exists arbitrarily long sentences that are so long that the Markov chain "forgets where it was". The argument is similar to the [pumping lemma for regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages).</span></span>

It seems to me that Dreyfus' 1965 critiques of 1960s AI approaches were largely correct, for roughly the right reasons, in a way that seems quite impressive in hindsight... Dreyfus' arguments are inspired by his background in phenomenological philosophy, but he expresses his arguments in clear and straightforward language... the AI community hardly responded to Dreyfus' critique at all -- and when they did, they often misrepresented his claims and arguments in ways that are easy to detect if one merely checks Dreyfus' original report.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-1616"><a href="#cb11-1616" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>With that, I managed to understand Dreyfus' argument clearly. His main point is that logical AI, exemplified by Simon and Newell's GPS,  cannot reach human-level reasoning, because logical AI cannot perform 3 fundamental human forms of information processing: fringe consciousness, essence/accident discrimination, and ambiguity tolerance. These require brain-like computers to perform.</span>
<span id="cb11-1617"><a href="#cb11-1617" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-1618"><a href="#cb11-1618" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Fringe consciousness: Chess players do not analyze positions like the GPS. Whereas the GPS performs a unified heuristic search, chess players seem to unconsciously scan a large number of positions, making some variations seem salient, which they then consciously "count out". The unconscious scanning is *not* search, since otherwise why not perform unconscious search all the way to the finish line? The conscious "counting out" is captured by the GPS, but the unconscious "zeroing in" is not.</span>
<span id="cb11-1619"><a href="#cb11-1619" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Essence/accident discrimination: Even on simple, well-defined problems like cryptogram puzzles, the GPS and humans reason very differently. Humans can simplify problems with symmetry like "for basically the same reason...", and backtrack based on an understanding of the overall problem structure. Even Simon and Newell have labelled their human subjects' reasoning steps as either "essential" or "inessential". GPS solves a problem like humans do only if the programmers have so helpfully pre-structured the problem with the essential features. These all show that human reasoning distinguishes some as essential while others as accidental, and focuses their conscious problem solving over the essential features, something GPS cannot do.</span>
<span id="cb11-1620"><a href="#cb11-1620" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Ambiguity tolerance: So far, machine translation and language understanding research had only worked on highly artificial and restricted domains, since none of them could handle the ambiguity in natural language. Humans can handle this massive ambiguity because humans process language not according to precise rules, but by unconscious processing that statistically combines context, goals, and background knowledge, and produces *precise enough* outputs.</span>

<span id="cb11-1622"><a href="#cb11-1622" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>From our vantage point, chess ended up falling to the heuristic search of DeepBlue, but Go did require combining "fringe consciousness" with heuristic search in the CNN+MCTS architecture of AlphaGo. The three forms of information processing he singled out as requiring brain-like computing turned out to be precisely where neural networks achieved breakout success. Of course, the logical AI camp would not go down without a fight, and with "Parallel Distributed Processing" -- the revival of neural networks in 1980s -- there would be a bitter dispute, centered around, of all things, how to form the past tense of English verbs.<span class="ot">[^dreyfus-2012]</span></span>

But that just is the first step fallacy. AI is always just round the corner but, as Chalmers himself admits, never succeeds in turning that corner. There is, in fact, *no reason to think that we are making progress towards AI or, indeed, that AI is even possible, in which case claiming incremental progress towards it would make no sense.*</span></span>

<span id="cb11-1648"><a href="#cb11-1648" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In the context of AI, this means that a symbolic system, no matter how complex, will always have limitations in representing and reasoning about the world, even if the world is but itself.

<span id="cb11-1650"><a href="#cb11-1650" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>His solution was to add in some "strange loops", which would both create general intelligence and create consciousness in one fell swoop. These strange loops are hierarchical structures where crossing levels leads back to the starting point. In the context of AI, Hofstadter proposed that implementing strange loops within a symbolic system would allow the system to refer to itself and its own structure, potentially leading to self-awareness and general intelligence. This self-referential capability would enable the system to overcome the limitations imposed by the incompleteness theorems and exhibit more flexible and human-like intelligence.</span>

The main message that I tried to deliver in the book was that classical statistics could not overcome the curse of dimensionality but the new approach could. I devoted three chapters of the book to different classical approaches and demonstrated that none of them could overcome the curse of dimensionality. Only after that did I describe the new theory.</span></span>

The whole point of science is to open up black boxes, understand their insides, and build better boxes for the purposes of mankind. Leo himself is a notably successful scientist, so we can hope that the present paper was written more as an advocacy device than as the confessions of a born-again black boxist.</span></span>

<span id="cb11-1708"><a href="#cb11-1708" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>"Connectionism" is a word you don't see much nowadays, but it was a big word back in the 1980s. It is hard to pin down, but if I summarize it, it is the result of philosophers in the 1980s noticing how researchers were trying neural networks on problems that had defied logical AI approaches, and somehow achieved state of the art, way past expectations. They say, "Weird! How is it possible for neural networks, written by people not having a deep knowledge of the problem domain, using such simplistic features, to work better than the best logical AI? I must philosophize this at once!"</span>
