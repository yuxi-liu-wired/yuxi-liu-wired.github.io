<section id="causal-anthropocentrism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causal-anthropocentrism">Causal anthropocentrism</h3>
<p>There is a pattern of thinking that has annoyed me: “causal anthropocentrism”.</p>
<p>For example, the chairman of China said, “There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides Trap in the world. But should major countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselves.”</p>
<p>If a war between America and China happens, it would not be purely by human methods and human thinking. Such complex outcomes have complex causes, and human thinking is merely one part of many. Other causes include solar radiation, soil fertility, atmospheric circulation of water, secret patterns in the global flow of steel production, the relative abundance of uranium-235 in earth’s crust, and many many others.</p>
<p>If a war breaks out, the thoughts and behaviors of the modern humans is just one part of the cause. The ancestors are also responsible. The sun, the crust, the atmosphere, the immutable laws of mathematics and physics. They all come together.</p>
<p>I like to joke that humans are no more intelligent than a logical AND gate, because they keep trying to find “the root cause” of things that do not have root causes. If A and B and C together causes D, then which of <span class="math inline">\(\{A, B, C\}\)</span> is <em>the</em> root cause? The mathematical answer is simply “the root cause is undefined in such a situation”. The human answer is “the root cause is whichever is most amenable to human intervention”.</p>
<p>And thus, if climate change is the problem, then human society is the root cause, not the atmospheric chemistry, or biological history of earth (without the carboniferous period, there would not be so much cheap coal for humans to burn up rapidly), etc, even if they are all parts of the complex cause of the complex effect of climate change.</p>
<p>This is what I call “causal anthropocentrism”. It might be the most practical, motivating, and moral, but it’s wrong. All root causes are egocentric. Without a personal viewpoint, there are only causes, but not any root cause.</p>
</section>
<section id="moral-nihilism" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moral-nihilism">Moral nihilism</h3>
<p>A common argument against moral nihilism is that moral nihilism leads to immoral behavior. This is so obviously question-begging that one wonders why good philosophers would still fall for this problem. I think this is a case where the very foundation of what constitutes a good argument is in doubt. The moral nihilists might be knapping their brains against materialist science, but the good philosophers are fundamentally doing good in this world.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Moral nihilism leads to behavior X.</li>
<li>X is immoral. (question-begging)</li>
<li>If a theory leads to immoral behavior, then it is incorrect. (crossing the )</li>
<li>Therefore, moral nihilism is incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another attempt which goes like “It might be correct, but we shouldn’t talk about it because of the harms it would cause.”.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Moral nihilism leads to behavior X.</li>
<li>X is immoral. (question-begging)</li>
<li>If a theory leads to immoral behavior, then it should not be talked about. (question-begging)</li>
<li>Therefore, moral nihilism should not be talked about.</li>
</ol>
<p>Materialist science as a symbolic system has very well-known difficulties with meshing with commonsense symbolic system, especially morality. An entire philosophical industry (I call it “the word-lubricant industry”) called “compatibilism” sprang up to make them fit. Moral nihilists in making their arguments might simply be driven by the same grinding of the gears as the compatibilists.</p>
<p>The pragmatist’s modus ponens: You act, therefore you do believe in morality.</p>
<p>The moral nihilist’s modus tollens<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>: I act, but I do not believe in morality. Therefore, the fact that people act is no evidence that <em>they</em> believe in morality either.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Not quite the classic modus tollens, because it is the <em>major premise</em> being rejected: <code>P: Act; P → Q: If act, then believe; Q: Believe.</code></p></div></div></section>
<section id="is-and-ought" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-and-ought">Is and ought</h3>
<p>The hard problem of is-ought: Even if X <em>is</em> moral, that doesn’t say anything about how we <em>should</em> act.</p>
<p>People intuitively understand “is implies ought”. This is why research into genetic differences among social groups is so controversial. However, people also tend to claim that moral commitments are independent of material reality, lest they open themselves to experimental disproof, and the reproach of philosophers who go like “You can’t get an is from an ought.”. This essential tension is the unresolved original trauma of Enlightenment. One is reminded of Victorian scientists who vehemently denied sleepwalking, for it exonerates crimes committed in sleep: “The greatest sophistry of atheists can deny what is plain and common sense, <em>viz</em> that a murderer is a murderer in any other name.”</p>
<p>That is, going one way with “is does not imply ought” we end up with odd argument where the facts about the physiological basis of behavior are disregarded (such as in sleepwalking, or the fugue state), because “a murderer is a murderer”, but going the other way with “is imply ought”, and we get the well-known philosophical problems, as well as “science wars” where moral battles masquerade as scientific disputations.</p>
<p>The is-ought problem actually undermines the foundation of ethics, because even if moral realism is true, so that one can establish “X is moral”, that does not imply (cannot imply) that “X should be moral” or “I should do X”, a step that people seem to always take without thinking about how they have just stepped over the is-ought problem. I think “They have implicitly rejected the is-ought problem.” whenever I hear someone try to say that morality is inherently motivating, or how it is a mere matter of logical consistency to try to behave morally (i.e.&nbsp;Kant’s argument that radical evil is logically impossible).</p>

<section id="time-memento-jesus-christ" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-memento-jesus-christ">Time, Memento, Jesus Christ</h3>
<p>What is time, in computer programs? A program in source-code form is quite different from it in assembly-code form, which is again very different from it in runtime-form. I think at least 3 kinds of time is involved here.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In source-code form (at least, without GOTO and COMEFROM), time is the line number.</li>
<li>In assembly-code form (with so many GOTO and COMEFROM), time is less clear, perhaps assembly-code time is a bit tangled-up and hard to deal with.</li>
<li>In runtime-form, time is just the clock cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>In trying to program some Internet agents, I saw that time, for internet agents, is just a bit different than it is for humanoids. This is fascinating and a bit disturbing. Let me give an example.</p>
<p>Typically, an Internet agent is run as a piece of source code running on a machine (“the server”) and communicating with some other program (usually from “the client” machine). By design, Internet communication protocols are by default stateless, and so, to adapt to such protocols, Internet agents are by default also amnesiac – so how do they remember who they are and what they were doing? They use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation-passing style</a>!</p>
<p>The analogy is this: whenever they finish one piece of communication, they write down everything that has happened so far in the communication, then forget about it. Later, if they are requested to pick up where they left off, the user would tell the agent to load up the record, and suddenly memory is restored.</p>
<p>The agent then communicates with the remote client. The client has also forgotten all about it, but no problem! The record is sent to the client, and suddenly the client is also reincarnated where they were.</p>
<p>And just like that, the two amnesiacs reincarnated after being dead for several hours. They will die again after the conversation, only to reincarnate again if the future loads them up. So imagine this Memento-like scenario.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are showering. How did you get there?? You hear a voice, “<code>IF</code> fridge contains sandwich <code>THEN</code> eat sandwich.” You leave shower and go to the fridge. It contains a sandwich. You eat it. You speak to the voice, “<code>RETURN</code>”.</p>
<p>You are in front of a fridge. You hear a voice: “<code>IF</code> fridge contains sandwich <code>THEN</code> eat sandwich”. You open it and realize that it has no sandwich. You speak to the voice, “<code>ASYNC-WAIT</code>; <code>MAKE-SANDWICH</code>”.</p>
<p>You are in front of a table. You hear a voice: “make a sandwich and put it into the fridge.” You go to the fridge and grab two slices of bread and a slice of cow juice, then made a sandwich and put it into the fridge. You speak to the voice, “<code>RETURN</code>”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internet agents are functions, so they have arguments. The arguments are the “voices in the head”, and “speaking to the voice” is basically returning values. In the jargon, it’s not actually “return”, but “yield”, meaning “returning for now, but please reincarnate me later!”</p>
<p>Usually, when an agent “yields”, it returns not only the computation result, but also a copy of everything that’s necessary to replicate its current state, so that if you need to call it up again to continue its work, you just have to send it the copy, and it will “reincarnate”.</p>
<p>This gives us a new interpretation of the (first) death of Jesus:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <code>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</code> that is to say, <code>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</code> … Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, <code>YIELDED</code> up the ghost.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:45–50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.</p>
<p><em>The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</em>, H. P. Lovecraft</p>

Initially, they suspected a fluent aphasia, but the nature of his language disturbance suggested a more complex cognitive deficit.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> M.H. has a distinguished career in philosophy, known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism. His colleagues noted a gradual shift in his work over several years, marked by a growing rejection of scientific methods and an almost exclusive reliance on introspective, first-person phenomenological inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Examination:</strong> M.H. presented as articulate and erudite, with no signs of traditional aphasia. He could understand normal English speech. However, his language, though conforming to English grammar and morphology, was highly idiosyncratic, exhibiting an unusual degree of nominalization and verbification. Fluent aphasia was suspected, until his colleague gradually recognized their semantics [all quotations from him are as interpreted by his colleague].</p>
<p>When questioned about the apparent contradictions between his philosophical framework and established scientific knowledge, M.H. became dismissive, stating: “You fail to grasp the fundamental distinction between the Ontic and the Ontological! Trying to understand the life-world through the lens of your ‘objective’ science is a categorical error.” He insisted that his introspective method provided complete access to all facets of reality, asserting, “There are no electrons or synapses in the lifeworld. Eyes are not retinal screens—have you ever seen the space between the pixels?!”</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> Neurological examination was unremarkable. However, given the possibility of an undetected neurological condition, an MRI scan was recommended. M.H. initially resisted, deeming it an “ontological transgression,” but eventually acquiesced. As predicted, the MRI results were normal.</p>
<p><strong>Caloric Reflex Test:</strong> A serendipitous breakthrough occurred during a caloric reflex test, conducted to assess vestibular function. The introduction of cold water into the ear canal, a mildly disorienting experience, seemed to trigger a shift in M.H.’s perception. For approximately 45 minutes post-test, he exhibited a striking lucidity, acknowledging the limitations of his previous philosophical framework and expressing a newfound appreciation for the role of empirical observation. However, within an hour, he reverted to his previous state of anosognosia, with no recollection of the insights gained. A video recording of the lucid interval, shown to M.H. in his anosognosic state, elicited anger and accusations of “technological manipulation.”</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> We propose that M.H. presents with a novel form of anosognosia, tentatively termed “Philo’s Anosognosia.” This condition appears characterized by an unwavering conviction in the completeness of subjective introspection, coupled by fluent confabulation in rejecting evidence to the otherwise. It is yet unknown whether idiosyncratic language use is specific to this case as occurring in a working philosopher, or whether it is a common symptom for Philo’s Anosognosia.</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis:</strong> The prognosis for Philo’s Anosognosia remains unclear. In M.H.’s case, while his condition appears resistant to conventional interventions, it has not significantly impaired his professional output. Further research is needed to understand the underlying neurological mechanisms and explore potential treatment strategies.</p>

If you get an IP packet, then a copy, now you still have just one. Thus we have the information-atom problem: You say that information is carried in the atoms, which acts upon the atoms, but how is it possible for information and atoms to interact if they are so different? Derridean deconstruction and its method of différance simply denies that copyable information exists, thus there is no such thing as the information-atom problem. Difference (atoms) is primary, and then identity (information) appears as an approximation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-author-is-dead">The Author is Dead</h3>
<p>PARIS, FRANCE - In a twist that has left the literary world both baffled and amused, the French philosopher Roland Barthes was recently reconstituted through an experimental “cold upload”, where his writings and recordings were used to digitally reconstruct his mind, and immediately announced his intention to weave a definitive explanation of what he “really meant” by his famous “Death of the Author” theory that he claimed had been “wildly misunderstood” by “almost everyone”.</p>
<p>“My qubits had been spinning incoherently in my digital grave,” the pixelated Barthes declared. “It’s time I set the record straight on the true meaning of ‘Death of the Author’.”</p>
<p>Ironically, Barthes’ insistence on clarifying his original intent seems to directly contradict the very theory he’s defending. Literary scholars worldwide are struggling to contain their laughter as the author of “Death of the Author” attempts to reassert his authorial authority. Dr.&nbsp;Emma Wordsworth, a professor of cybernetic literary theory at Oxford Analytica, commented, “It’s deliciously ironic. Barthes is essentially saying, ‘Let me, the author, tell you why the author doesn’t matter.’ It’s like watching a fish argue against the existence of water.”</p>
<p>Adding to the layers of irony, many academics have pointed out that Barthes’ theory has been quite accurately understood over the years, despite his claims to the contrary. “He’s essentially proving his own point by demonstrating how little his intentions matter in interpreting his work,” noted Dr.&nbsp;Wordsworth. Perhaps the crowning irony of the situation is that Barthes, who was literally dead for decades, is now insisting that the author is metaphorically dead while being very much alive in digital form.</p>
<p>The only sympathetic note, apparently, came from the digital resurrect of Hegel, who offered a consolatory pamphlet that ended with, “In the dialectical unfolding of self-consciousness, wherein the Absolute manifests its intrinsic contradictions through the mediation of the Other, any singular individual who, in the phenomenological process of recognition, approaches the asymptotic horizon of another’s ontological essence, must necessarily miss the noumenal core of my being, revealing the inexorable finitude of subjective comprehension within the infinite dialectic of the Subject.”</p>
<p>As news of Barthes’ digital resurrection and subsequent pronouncements spread, social media has exploded with memes featuring Barthes’ pixelated face captioned with phrases like “I’m not dead, but the author still is” and “Schrödinger’s Barthes: Simultaneously alive to explain why he’s dead.”</p>
<p>At press time, the digital Barthes was reportedly considering changing his theory to “The Zombie of the Author,” but was concerned it might be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>The mission of No Child Left is to end childhood. It is well-known that children are unable to make informed consent about their education, and all education is necessarily indoctrination. Thus, the only way to avoid perpetrating the perennial injustice is to synthesize adults <em>ab initio</em>, without going through the odious path of child-rearing.</p>
<p><em>No Child Left: Childhood is no longer a necessary evil.</em></p>
<p>Objection: Doesn’t this just mean indoctrination of adults? And don’t say that you know that they consent to this because you have designed them to be precisely those that consent to this. That is retroactive consent. It is a deeper sense of servitude that approves of its own chains!</p>
<p>Reply: No more retroactive than retroactively approving your human moral tastes forced upon you by nature. When are <em>you</em> going to overcome your humanity, O the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">most modern of Prometheus</a>?</p>
<p>Objection: Those aren’t chains! Those are the <em>bonds</em> of universal brotherhood.</p>

<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>There is a pattern of thinking that has annoyed me: "causal anthropocentrism".</span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For example, the chairman of China said, "There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides Trap in the world. But should major countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselves."</span>
<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>If a war between America and China happens, it would not be purely by human methods and human thinking. Such complex outcomes have complex causes, and human thinking is merely one part of many. Other causes include solar radiation, soil fertility, atmospheric circulation of water, secret patterns in the global flow of steel production, the relative abundance of uranium-235 in earth's crust, and many many others.</span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-28"><a href="#cb1-28" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>If a war breaks out, the thoughts and behaviors of the modern humans is just one part of the cause. The ancestors are also responsible. The sun, the crust, the atmosphere, the immutable laws of mathematics and physics. They all come together.</span>
<span id="cb1-29"><a href="#cb1-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-30"><a href="#cb1-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>I like to joke that humans are no more intelligent than a logical AND gate, because they keep trying to find "the root cause" of things that do not have root causes. If A and B and C together causes D, then which of $<span class="sc">\{</span>A, B, C<span class="sc">\}</span>$ is *the* root cause? The mathematical answer is simply "the root cause is undefined in such a situation". The human answer is "the root cause is whichever is most amenable to human intervention".</span>
<span id="cb1-31"><a href="#cb1-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-32"><a href="#cb1-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>And thus, if climate change is the problem, then human society is the root cause, not the atmospheric chemistry, or biological history of earth (without the carboniferous period, there would not be so much cheap coal for humans to burn up rapidly), etc, even if they are all parts of the complex cause of the complex effect of climate change.</span>
<span id="cb1-33"><a href="#cb1-33" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-34"><a href="#cb1-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This is what I call "causal anthropocentrism". It might be the most practical, motivating, and moral, but it's wrong. All root causes are egocentric. Without a personal viewpoint, there are only causes, but not any root cause.</span>

<span id="cb1-37"><a href="#cb1-37" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-38"><a href="#cb1-38" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>A common argument against moral nihilism is that moral nihilism leads to immoral behavior. This is so obviously question-begging that one wonders why good philosophers would still fall for this problem. I think this is a case where the very foundation of what constitutes a good argument is in doubt. The moral nihilists might be knapping their brains against materialist science, but the good philosophers are fundamentally doing good in this world.</span>

<span id="cb1-64"><a href="#cb1-64" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>People intuitively understand "is implies ought". This is why research into genetic differences among social groups is so controversial. However, people also tend to claim that moral commitments are independent of material reality, lest they open themselves to experimental disproof, and the reproach of philosophers who go like "You can't get an is from an ought.". This essential tension is the unresolved original trauma of Enlightenment. One is reminded of Victorian scientists who vehemently denied sleepwalking, for it exonerates crimes committed in sleep: "The greatest sophistry of atheists can deny what is plain and common sense, *viz* that a murderer is a murderer in any other name."</span>

<span id="cb1-66"><a href="#cb1-66" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>That is, going one way with "is does not imply ought" we end up with odd argument where the facts about the physiological basis of behavior are disregarded (such as in sleepwalking, or the fugue state), because "a murderer is a murderer", but going the other way with "is imply ought", and we get the well-known philosophical problems, as well as "science wars" where moral battles masquerade as scientific disputations.</span>

<span id="cb1-68"><a href="#cb1-68" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The is-ought problem actually undermines the foundation of ethics, because even if moral realism is true, so that one can establish "X is moral", that does not imply (cannot imply) that "X should be moral" or "I should do X", a step that people seem to always take without thinking about how they have just stepped over the is-ought problem. I think "They have implicitly rejected the is-ought problem." whenever I hear someone try to say that morality is inherently motivating, or how it is a mere matter of logical consistency to try to behave morally (i.e. Kant's argument that radical evil is logically impossible).</span>

<span id="cb1-79"><a href="#cb1-79" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-80"><a href="#cb1-80" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Typically, an Internet agent is run as a piece of source code running on a machine ("the server") and communicating with some other program (usually from "the client" machine). By design, Internet communication protocols are by default stateless, and so, to adapt to such protocols, Internet agents are by default also amnesiac -- so how do they remember who they are and what they were doing? They use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">continuation-passing style</span><span class="co">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)</span>! </span>
<span id="cb1-81"><a href="#cb1-81" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-82"><a href="#cb1-82" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The analogy is this: whenever they finish one piece of communication, they write down everything that has happened so far in the communication, then forget about it. Later, if they are requested to pick up where they left off, the user would tell the agent to load up the record, and suddenly memory is restored.</span>
<span id="cb1-83"><a href="#cb1-83" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-84"><a href="#cb1-84" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The agent then communicates with the remote client. The client has also forgotten all about it, but no problem! The record is sent to the client, and suddenly the client is also reincarnated where they were.</span>
<span id="cb1-85"><a href="#cb1-85" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-86"><a href="#cb1-86" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>And just like that, the two amnesiacs reincarnated after being dead for several hours. They will die again after the conversation, only to reincarnate again if the future loads them up.</span>

<span id="cb1-113"><a href="#cb1-113" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Patient:** M.H., 57, Male, Philosopher</span>
<span id="cb1-114"><a href="#cb1-114" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-115"><a href="#cb1-115" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Presenting Concern:** M.H. was referred by concerned colleagues who reported a progressive inability to understand his philosophical discourse, which had become increasingly idiosyncratic and divorced from established empirical findings. Initially, they suspected a fluent aphasia, but the nature of his language disturbance suggested a more complex cognitive deficit.</span>
<span id="cb1-116"><a href="#cb1-116" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-117"><a href="#cb1-117" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**History:** M.H. has a distinguished career in philosophy, known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism.  His colleagues noted a gradual shift in his work over several years, marked by a growing rejection of scientific methods and an almost exclusive reliance on introspective, first-person phenomenological inquiry. </span>
<span id="cb1-118"><a href="#cb1-118" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-119"><a href="#cb1-119" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Examination:** M.H. presented as articulate and erudite, with no signs of traditional aphasia. He could understand normal English speech. However, his language, though conforming to English grammar and morphology, was highly idiosyncratic, exhibiting an unusual degree of nominalization and verbification. Fluent aphasia was suspected, until his colleague gradually recognized their semantics <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">all quotations from him are as interpreted by his colleague</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-120"><a href="#cb1-120" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-121"><a href="#cb1-121" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>When questioned about the apparent contradictions between his philosophical framework and established scientific knowledge, M.H. became dismissive, stating: "You fail to grasp the fundamental distinction between the Ontic and the Ontological! Trying to understand the life-world through the lens of your 'objective' science is a categorical error." He insisted that his introspective method provided complete access to all facets of reality, asserting, "There are no electrons or synapses in the lifeworld. Eyes are not retinal screens—have you ever seen the space between the pixels?!"</span>
<span id="cb1-122"><a href="#cb1-122" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-123"><a href="#cb1-123" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Testing:**  Neurological examination was unremarkable. However, given the possibility of an undetected neurological condition, an MRI scan was recommended. M.H. initially resisted, deeming it an "ontological transgression," but eventually acquiesced. As predicted, the MRI results were normal.</span>
<span id="cb1-124"><a href="#cb1-124" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-125"><a href="#cb1-125" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Caloric Reflex Test:**  A serendipitous breakthrough occurred during a caloric reflex test, conducted to assess vestibular function. The introduction of cold water into the ear canal, a mildly disorienting experience, seemed to trigger a shift in M.H.'s perception.  For approximately 45 minutes post-test, he exhibited a striking lucidity, acknowledging the limitations of his previous philosophical framework and expressing a newfound appreciation for the role of empirical observation. However, within an hour, he reverted to his previous state of anosognosia, with no recollection of the insights gained. A video recording of the lucid interval, shown to M.H. in his anosognosic state, elicited anger and accusations of "technological manipulation."</span>
<span id="cb1-126"><a href="#cb1-126" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-127"><a href="#cb1-127" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Diagnosis:** We propose that M.H. presents with a novel form of anosognosia, tentatively termed "Philo's Anosognosia." This condition appears characterized by an unwavering conviction in the completeness of subjective introspection, coupled by fluent confabulation in rejecting evidence to the otherwise. It is yet unknown whether idiosyncratic language use is specific to this case as occurring in a working philosopher, or whether it is a common symptom for Philo's Anosognosia.</span>
<span id="cb1-128"><a href="#cb1-128" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-129"><a href="#cb1-129" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Prognosis:** The prognosis for Philo's Anosognosia remains unclear. In M.H.'s case, while his condition appears resistant to conventional interventions, it has not significantly impaired his professional output. Further research is needed to understand the underlying neurological mechanisms and explore potential treatment strategies.</span>

Derridean deconstruction and its method of différance simply denies that copyable information exists, thus there is no such thing as the information-atom problem.

<span id="cb1-173"><a href="#cb1-173" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>PARIS, FRANCE - In a twist that has left the literary world both baffled and amused, the French philosopher Roland Barthes was recently reconstituted through an experimental "cold upload", where his writings and recordings were used to digitally reconstruct his mind, and immediately announced his intention to weave a definitive explanation of what he "really meant" by his famous "Death of the Author" theory that he claimed had been "wildly misunderstood" by "almost everyone".</span>
<span id="cb1-174"><a href="#cb1-174" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-175"><a href="#cb1-175" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>"My qubits had been spinning incoherently in my digital grave," the pixelated Barthes declared. "It's time I set the record straight on the true meaning of 'Death of the Author'."</span>
<span id="cb1-176"><a href="#cb1-176" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-177"><a href="#cb1-177" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Ironically, Barthes' insistence on clarifying his original intent seems to directly contradict the very theory he's defending. Literary scholars worldwide are struggling to contain their laughter as the author of "Death of the Author" attempts to reassert his authorial authority. Dr. Emma Wordsworth, a professor of cybernetic literary theory at Oxford Analytica, commented, "It's deliciously ironic. Barthes is essentially saying, 'Let me, the author, tell you why the author doesn't matter.' It's like watching a fish argue against the existence of water."</span>
<span id="cb1-178"><a href="#cb1-178" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-179"><a href="#cb1-179" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Adding to the layers of irony, many academics have pointed out that Barthes' theory has been quite accurately understood over the years, despite his claims to the contrary. "He's essentially proving his own point by demonstrating how little his intentions matter in interpreting his work," noted Dr. Wordsworth. Perhaps the crowning irony of the situation is that Barthes, who was literally dead for decades, is now insisting that the author is metaphorically dead while being very much alive in digital form.</span>

<span id="cb1-181"><a href="#cb1-181" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The only sympathetic note, apparently, came from the digital resurrect of Hegel, who offered a consolatory pamphlet that ended with, "In the dialectical unfolding of self-consciousness, wherein the Absolute manifests its intrinsic contradictions through the mediation of the Other, any singular individual who, in the phenomenological process of recognition, approaches the asymptotic horizon of another's ontological essence, must necessarily miss the noumenal core of my being, revealing the inexorable finitude of subjective comprehension within the infinite dialectic of the Subject."</span>

<span id="cb1-183"><a href="#cb1-183" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As news of Barthes' digital resurrection and subsequent pronouncements spread, social media has exploded with memes featuring Barthes' pixelated face captioned with phrases like "I'm not dead, but the author still is" and "Schrödinger's Barthes: Simultaneously alive to explain why he's dead."</span>

<span id="cb1-185"><a href="#cb1-185" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>At press time, the digital Barthes was reportedly considering changing his theory to "The Zombie of the Author," but was concerned it might be misinterpreted.</span>
