Many years later, surrounded by the humming servers of the knowledge base, Douglas Lenat was to remember that distant afternoon when he taught Cyc that everyone can only see their own dream.

## Automated Mathematician

Lenat's first claim to fame was the Automated Mathematician (AM), which became a minor legend. It occurred in the context of many "automated discovery" systems in the 1970s. Neural networks and other "self-organized" machine learning methods have mostly [died out in the 1960s](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/perceptron-controversy/), but machine learning did not die, and indeed, was going through its first spring, under the name "automated discovery".

Nowadays, when we think of "machine learning", we think of random forests, neural networks, and such. But back then, machine learning was understood as "logical AI gone meta". Simon and Newell, the two giants of logical AI, showed the way: logical AI is heuristic search. 

* To play chess, one simply write a program that does alpha-beta search over the game tree, guided by heuristics of piece-worth, mobility, and such.
* To solve planar geometry problems, one simply write a program that construct a path in the space of reasons, until one connects the axioms with the conclusions.
* To solve problems of type X, one simply write a program that can move through the space of possible solutions to X, and code in the heuristic rules, its north star, so that it will not be lost in the space of solutions.

Well, chess is a game, and so is Euclidean geometry, symbolic integration, and... perhaps scientific discovery itself? The famed scientific method, to deserve the name "method", ought to be one more problem for logical AI to solve.

During 1977--1983, Pat Langley wrote a series of programs named BACON, after [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon), a father of scientific empiricism. It purported to discover scientific laws from mere data. For example, when given a table of the moles $N$, pressures $P$, volumes $V$, and temperatures $T$ of gas samples, BACON would first try out simple equations involving two of the terms. It would discover that the data for $PV$ appears more "clusterly" than either $P$ or $V$, so it makes a new quantity $PV$, and add that to the table. It then repeat this process, discovering that $PV/T$ is an interesting quantity, and finally discovers that $PV/NT$ is a *constant* quantity -- the ideal gas law discovered! [@langleyDataDrivenDiscoveryPhysical1981]

In the logical AI framework, the problem space of BACON is the space of all elementary functions involving the table columns, and a *solution* is a (nontrivial) function that results in a nearly constant column. At each step, the program tries out simple combinations of the current columns, and heuristically pick the one most nearly constant.

As another example, the famed Meta-Dendral was a further development of Dendral. With Dendral, the problem space is the space of possible molecular cleavages and atomic transfers, and the heuristics are the chemical rules for plausible and implausible cleavages and transfers. For example, it is plausible for a protein to be cleaved at the `-CO-*-NH-` peptide bond, but implausible to be cleaved at the double bond between `C` and `O`. The goal is, given molecular spectroscopic data for a single molecule, construct a molecular structure and a sequence of cleavages and transfers, such that it would produce the data. 

With Meta-Dendral, the problem space becomes the space of possible chemical rules, and the goal is to find plausible rules (plausible according to heuristic meta-rules) that can explain a large collection of molecular structures and their spectroscopic data. Meta-Dendral proved useful for workig chemists by discovering some cleavage rules for a family of [steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid). For details, see my essay on [TODO](TODO).

In general, such a system begins with some simple rules that allow the system to a low score according to some criteria. and as it runs, it builds, prunes, and modifies the rules, so that in the end, its rule set allows it to achieve a high score. The following tabulates a few [@walkerHowFeasibleAutomated1987]:

| System Name | Date | Task | Data | Rules | Discovery Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meta-Dendral | 1976 | Discover molecular cleavage and transfer rules for mass spectrometry | Molecular structures and their spetra | Molecular cleavage and transfer rules | Use meta-heuristic rules to generate possible rules, and test on data |
| Bacon | 1977--1983 | Discover physical laws | Numeric data from experiments | Elementary functions | Symbolic regression |
| RX | 1982 | Discover drug side effects and interactions | Patient information database | Drug effect and interaction rules | Symbolic regression with time-lag |

Out of this context, AM is different. It is still a logical AI with a problem space and a heuristic search. However, there is no data: It is mostly "self-play". Lenat would begin by entering 115 concepts in set theory and ~300 heuristic rules, and AM would just keep running, discovering more and more constructions are uninteresting, but a few would be interesting, and these interesting constructions would be stored, allowing further constructions upon them. It was a minor legend, since it reportedly rediscovered many concepts, such as natural numbers, prime numbers, and the Goldbach conjecture.

A **concept** is essentially a [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)), which are essentially objects in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). A concept has 25 possible **facets**, which are "slots", or "data fields". The following is an example concept with many facets populated:

- NAME: Prime Numbers
- DEFINITIONS:
    - ORIGIN: Number-of-divisors-of(x) = 2
    - PREDICATE-CALCULUS: Prime(x):= $(\forall z)(z | x \to z = 1 \wedge z = x)$
    - ITERATIVE: (for x>1): For i from 2 to $\sqrt x,\neg(i | x)$
- EXAMPLES: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17
    - BOUNDARY: 2, 3
    - BOUNDARY-FAILURES: 0,1
    - FAILURES: 12
- GENERALIZATIONS: Nos., Nos. with an even number of divisors, Nos. with a prime number of divisors.
- SPECIALIZATIONS: Odd Primes, Prime Pairs, Prime Uniquely-addables
- CONJECTURES: Unique factorization, Goldbach's conjecture, Extremes of Number-of-divisors-of
- INTUITIONS: A metaphor to the effect that Primes are the building blocks of all numbers
- ANALOGIES:
    - Maximally-divisible numbers are converse extremes of Number-of-divisors-of
    - Factor a non-simple group into simple groups.
- INTEREST: Conjectures tying Primes to TIMES, to Divisors-of, to closely related operations
- WORTH: 800

AM has an **agenda**, a list of **tasks** along with their **reasons**. Each task is of form "Do operation A to facet F of concept C". A task's **worth** is the sum of its reasons' worths. AM always performs the task with the highest worth.

To perform a task, AM looks for **heuristic rules** whose conditions are (mostly) satisfied, and whose worth is (pretty) high. Each heuristic rule is of form "if `<condition>`, then run `<actions>`". Each action has 3 kinds of possible effects:

- Add a new task to agenda.
- Create a new concept.
- Add or delete an entry to a facet of a concept.

Some example heuristic rules:

- If the task is to fill in examples of X, and X is a special case of Y, then for each example of Y, check if it a definition of X. If so, then add it to the list of examples of X.
- If some but not most examples of X are also examples of Y, then create a new concept "X and Y".
- If very few examples of X are found, then add the following task to the agenda: "Generalize the concept X", for the following reason: "X are quite rare; a slightly less restrictive concept might be more interesting".

At this point, the careful reader would notice several problems:

How does AM know that the concept should be called "Prime Numbers"? Ah, that's because Lenat would regularly interrupt and inspect AM, and if Lenat notices that AM has rediscovered, say, prime numbers, he would rename that from something like `concept-421` to `prime-numbers`.

To discover prime numbers, AM must have a way to check if a Lisp object is a prime number or not. That is, the definition must also be a program. Ah, the famous [homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) of Lisp came to the rescue! A definition, as stored within a facet of a concept, is a data, but for Lisp, data is program, and program data. Consequently, AM can run a subroutine that enumerates possible programs *as data*, and for each, interpret it *as program*, until AM hits upon a program that works (or times out). 

How does it check that two definitions actually define the same thing? In general, this is impossible by [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem), so Lenat must have used some heuristic rules. I looked, but can't find Lenat explaining this anywhere. It seemed like a trick of the hand.

If we look carefully at the example heuristic rules, then something odd happens. The heuristic rule "If some but not most examples of X are also examples of Y, then..." just talks about X and Y, but what is the context? Compare this with "If the task is to fill in examples of X, and X is a special case of Y, then...", where X is specified by the context "the task is to fill in examples of X". Now, we might be charitable and assume Lenat made a slip. However, there are even vaguer rules: "Formulate a parameterized conjecture, a 'template', which gets slowly specialized or instantiated into a definite conjecture". 

The issue came to a head with the publication of [@ritchieAMCaseStudy1984], which argued that AM was badly documented. The control structure probably was not "simply pick the task with the highest worth", but more complicated. Some crucial *quantitative* heuristic rules were probably hidden behind vague *qualitative* words like "A nonconstructive existence conjecture is interesting". The source code was unpublished and not available for other researchers for reproduction.

In short, because of the various issues, AM was a thing that happened, but not a thing that could be built upon. One cannot build upon it directly in source code, since it's unavailable. One cannot build upon it by reimplementing the pseudocode, since the rules were vaguely specified, and the control structure was probably wrong. One cannot build upon it by reimplementing the high-level ideas, since it's unclear which part, out of the several dozen tightly integrated parts of AM, was responsible for AM's good outputs, and which were just implementation details. (In our language, there was no ablation study.)

Lenat quickly replied with [@lenatWhyAmEurisko1984]. He dismissed the criticism as mostly miscommunication, and went on to describe the *real* lesson of AM. If I were to be dab, Lenat was saying that it is fine for AM's source,[^am-source-code] or even pseudocode, to be unavailable, because Lenat had learned the lessons, and you, dear reader, need only listen to the lessons from him.

> The AM thesis never explained, precisely, how concepts such as 'not very often' and 'related to' were implemented. By and large, these omissions were due to the fact that the code Lenat wrote for these predicates was quite trivial... inevitable, yet regrettable process of simplifying large pieces of code, translating them to brief English phrases. This process left out many exceptional cases, and made the English condensations less accurate... Some problems that Ritchie and Hanna cite... are simply errors of mis-reading what was stated in the thesis or articles... A few of the problems raised in Ritchie and Hanna's article are, annoyingly, genuine inconsistencies in the thesis document, such as whether or not facets had subfacets. These reflect the fact that AM was a running and evolving program, changing daily in small ways even as the thesis document was being written... the changes in representation were driven simply by AM'S running out of list space in 1975 [INTERLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlisp) code; we were forced to shift representations time and time again just to gain a few hundred precious list cells.
>
> [@lenatWhyAmEurisko1984]

[^am-source-code]: Though Lenat admitted that "the code ought to have been provided", he would never publish the code, not with AM, nor with Eurisko. He had often claimed it had been long lost, yet the source code for AM and Eurisko had [recently been found](https://white-flame.com/am-eurisko.html), right where it should be -- the [DBL folder in the Stanford AI Laboratory backup data](https://www.saildart.org/DBL). It could only be found because Lenat had died, thus releasing the password protection on the folder. I wonder if Lenat had lied, and simply wished to protect his source code.

And what are the lessons?

First lesson: AM exhausts itself. Roughly speaking, each new interesting discovery depends on ~24 heuristics, and each heuristic has a hand in ~24 discoveries. Therefore, with ~N heuristic rules, there would be ~N interesting discoveries. Because AM cannot discover heuristic rules, with ~300 starting heuristic rules, it would run out of interesting discoveries and "die of boredom". Lenat could help AM by adding new heuristics, and AM would make some new discoveries, but this never lasted.

> Eventually, AM acquired an uncommon ailment for a computing system: intellectual exhaustion. Having explored the esoteric reaches of mathematics, AM suddenly downshifted into a preoccupation with rudimentary arithmetic. Finally, with the remark, “Warning! No task on the agenda has priority over 200,” the system virtually expired, as though from boredom.
>
> [@hiltzikBirthThinkingMachine2001]

Second lesson: Representation matters a lot. AM works so well, because AM uses Lisp code as data. Lisp is the perfect tool if you want to search over the space of interesting mathematical functions. You can modify a Lisp expression, and get a different mathematical function that is possibly interesting. In contrast, if you modify an assembly code, you'd most likely end up with nonsense. Indeed, Lenat found that he could not extend AM to "go meta" and discover new heuristics, because Lisp is good for math, not "heuretics" (the study of heuristics). Modifying a Lisp expression for a heuristic most likely ends up with nonsense, much like assembly code.

> It was only because of the intimate relationship between LISP and Mathematics that the mutation operators (loop unwinding, recursion elimination, composition, argument elimination, function substitution, etc.) turned out to yield a WHY AM AND EURISKO APPEAR TO WORK 273 high 'hit rate' of viable, useful new math concepts when applied to previously- known, useful math concepts--concepts represented as LiSP functions. But no such deep relationship existed between LISP and Heuretics, and when the basic automatic programming (mutations) operators were applied to viable, useful heuristics, they almost always produced useless (often worse than useless) new heuristic rules.
>
> ...
> 
> We did not perceive until writing this paper that the way in which Similar-To, Not-Often, Notice-Regularity, and scores of other 'primitives' were coded do themselves embody a large amount of heuristic knowledge. We exploited the structure of (or, if you prefer, partially encoded) the domain of elementary mathematics, in the process of making trivial yet adequate usP versions of those extremely complex and subtle notions (such as similarity of concepts).
>
> [@lenatWhyAmEurisko1984]

Third lesson: There is no free lunch. Intelligence is a lot of work. You need to put in the right representational language for reasoning and discovery -- not just Lisp, but a lot more. You need to put in a lot of loosely organized, kind of correct heuristic rules -- not just a few eternal truths of discovery. You need to put in a lot of facts. You need to interact with the program, to help it along and to be helped along, not just to .

Fourth lesson: Intelligence is messy. Some might wish for a neat unitary framework for intelligence, and point at the messiness of AM's ~300 heuristic rules as a failing, but we should take it as strength and embrace the messiness.

> The apparent adhoc-ness in both the heuristics' content themselves, and in the control knowledge guiding the application of those heuristics, is clearly the source of many methodological objections to the work. But we believe that this adhocracy -- indeed, adhocracy controlling adhocracy -- may be the source of EURISKO'S underlying potential especially as a model for cognition.

> [@lenatWhyAmEurisko1984]

How do we know that Lenat learned the lessons? Introducing... Eurisko.

## Eurisko

AI alignment people often tell the legend of Eurisko, a program that discovered loopholes in a sci-fi ship-building tournament, allowing its creator to win two years in a row.

![The only known image of Eurisko reasoning about the Traveller game, probably on the Xerox 1100 Lisp machine. The GUI probably was in [Genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)). Lenat claimed Eurisko ran for 1300 CPU-hours in total. [@lenatComputerSoftwareIntelligent1984]](figure/Eurisko_GUI.png)

In his review article, Lenat made a brief philosophical comment that Eurisko is the new perceptron:

> ... the paradigm underlying AM and EURISKO may be thought of as the new generation of perceptrons, perceptrons based on collections or societies of evolving, self-organizing, symbolic knowledge structures. In classical perceptrons, all knowledge had to be encoded as topological networks of linked neurons, with weights on the links. The representation scheme being used by EURISKO provides much more powerful linkages, taking the form of heuristics about concepts, including heuristics for how to use and evolve heuristics. Both types of perceptrons rely on the law of large numbers, on a kind of local-global property of achieving adequate performance through the interactions of many small, relatively simple parts.
> 
> The classical perceptrons did hill-climbing, in spaces whose topology was defined explicitly by weights on arcs between nodes (nodes which did straightforward Boolean combinations plus thresholding). The EURISKO style of system does hill-climbing at both the object- (performance-program) and meta- (control decision) levels, in spaces whose terrain is defined implicitly, symbolically, by the contents of the nodes (nodes which are full-fledged concepts, at both object- and meta-levels). The new scheme fully exploits the same source of power (synergy through abundance) yet it is free from many of the limitations of the classical perceptron scheme.
> 
> [@lenatWhyAmEurisko1984]

If this sounds familiar, it is because this Lenat had the same idea as Marvin Minsky, and he was writing in 1984, at the second coming of neural networks. Minsky would soon write his *Society of Mind* (1986), and [re-reject neural networks by writing a long epilogue](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/perceptron-controversy/#minsky-and-papert-struck-back) to his infamous *Perceptrons* (1969), often blamed for the first neural network winter. Indeed, Lenat's objection to neural networks was essentially the same as Minsky's, if you compare that with Minsky's epilogue. Lenat's approach to Cyc was the same as the Society of Mind of Minsky. Reciprocating, Minsky had often called the field of AI "brain-dead", holding Lenat's Cyc as the only one worth mentioning. [@baardAIFounderBlasts2003]

## 10 million common senses

> **bogosity**: At CMU, bogosity is measured with a bogometer; in a seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say "My bogometer just triggered"... The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the microLenat.

The microLenat, originally invented by David Jefferson, was promulgated as an attack against noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a tenured graduate student at CMU. Doug had failed the student on an important exam because the student gave only "AI is bogus" as his answer to the questions. The slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has become a running gag nevertheless.

> 
> [@lenatCycUsingCommon1985]

In 1984, [Douglas Lenat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Lenat) began the Cyc project, an ambitious attempt to scale symbolic AI up to the real world. Like most expert systems, the Cyc project consists of a giant knowledge base that encodes all of common sense, upon which inference engines run. Unlike most expert systems, the ambition of Cyc was universal: Its knowledge base would not be restricted to expert knowledge in a particular domain, but *all* commonsense knowledge in *all* domains that humans have commonsense about.

The game plan was simple:

1. "Prime the knowledge pump" by manually encoding a large enough knowledge base of common senses in a logical language.
2. Construct a natural language interface based on the knowledge base.
3. Obtain an AI with common sense and natural language, allowing it to learn by reading what people have written down and conversing with people.
4. When it reaches the human frontier of knowledge, it will start performing experiments to go beyond it.

This would solve three problems in one go: 

1. No more brittleness of expert systems, because Cyc would have all the common senses.
2. Once it has enough knowledge, it would be able to machine-learn, and thus get past the knowledge bottleneck.
3. Expert systems would be able to talk with each other if they are all based on Cyc's common knowledge base.

A metaphor that Lenat had used often is that of a circle of ignorance. The more knowledge Cyc has, the easier it is for Cyc to learn more. At first, it must be spoon-fed knowledge with every entry entered by hand. As it builds a basic understanding of the world, it would be able to parse sentences half-way from natural language to logic, and the ontologists would help finish the job, and the more it knew, the better it could parse, saving more time, until it would start parsing without human help. On that day, the pump would finally, triumphantly, be primed, and Cyc would become history's first AI with common sense.

It remains to write the 10 million assertions.

10 million?


## What can it do?

* pro and con reasoning, to deal with non-factual or uncertain reasoning, such as "Is Christmas a commercialized holiday?" or "What factors argue for and against the conclusion that ETA performed the 2004-03 Madrid attacks?"
* construct long chains of justification
* convert justification into a constrained form of natural language

## Logic and reasoning

The basic Cyc concepts, according to the [current glossary](https://cyc.com/glossary/):

* `(#isa entity class)`: an entity is a member of a class. For example, `(#isa Socrates human)`.
* `(#genls class1 class2)`: a class is generalized to another class. For example, `(#genls human biped)`. 
* Heuristic level (HL) and epistemological level (EL) languages: 
* Assertions in the Cyc KB are similar to sentences stating facts and principles in a natural language such as English. However, each assertion has one intended meaning, and makes its context explicit. An assertion has several parts, including:  a CycL sentence a Truth value a Microtheory, which is the context where that sentence with that truth value holds 
* microtheory = Mt = context: a Cyc constant denoting assertions which are grouped together because they share a set of assumptions. Those assertions are said to be “in” that microtheory, and each assertion is in exactly one microtheory (although it is possible for assertions in different microtheories to have the same CycL sentence).



This allows us to write down predicates about predicates, necessary for metaheuristics, such as `instancesRelatedToInstancesOf(Ducks, imprintedTo, Ducks)` which means "If x is a Duck, and x in imprintedTo y, then y is a Duck". In general,

$$
\mathrm{instancesRelatedToInstancesOf}(X, A, Y) := \forall x, y, (X(x) \wedge A(x,y) \to Y(y))
$$

Here, $X, A, Y$ are predicates, so $\mathrm{instancesRelatedToInstancesOf}$ must be a predicate of predicates -- a second-order predicate. This can be repeated to make statements about n-th order predicates. Indeed, human beings in their daily life regularly construct high-order statements like "So you meant to make me upset by spreading rumors about her, which you knew that he would hear about it?" or "The whole point of nuclear deterrence is to credibly signal to the other side that if they were to attack, you would attack despite your best interests if it does happen."

Every logical system must face an impossible trilemma: an expressive language that can describe what people want to say, an efficient inference engine on the language, and a complete inference engine that can perform all correct inferences.

Cyc solved this trilemma by holding onto expressivity, trying to approach efficiency, and giving up completeness. The entire point of the project was to express *all* common sense, and that means expressivity is the core of the mission. Since humans are so impruden as to speak of high-order predicates everyday, CycL must be a higher-order logic. This gives it enough expressivity, but immediately makes it impossible to have a *computable* complete inference engine by Gödel-style incompleteness [@shapiroFoundationsFoundationalismCase1991, theorem 4.14], let alone having an *efficient* one. 

Like most expert systems, the Cyc has a general resolution-based inference engine. Unlike most expert systems, its knowledge base is large and higher-ordered, so its engine runs too slowly for most queries. Thus, the developers kept adding more specialized modules ("pattern-specific heuristic modules"), each capable of inferring on a small domain in a few microtheories. Like Eurisko, each of these module is mostly made of heuristics. Unlike Eurisko, most of these heuristics were entered by hand. There were also ~100M "cached" results so that Cyc need not infer from scratch every time.

The hardest step is step 1, a project that consumed over 2000 person-years, including the remainder of Lenat's life.

![A sketch of how to reason by backward-chaining together triples in a semantic web. The system is asked basically "Why does Clyde want to possess a crescent wrench?", and it eventually replies "Because Clyde has not eaten lately.". Lenat expected that the ontology of Cyc would eventually power generally intelligent agents, which would use forward-chaining to construct goals from current states, and use backward-chaining to explain why others have their goals. I can't help but wonder if Lenat meant for a subtle joke against the *Elephants don't play chess* by [@brooksElephantsDonPlay1990] by adding in a "dead end" branch that ends up concluding Clyde is an elephant. Figure from [@wallichSiliconBabies1991].](figure/CYC_triple_reasoning.png)

Even from the vantage point of 1985, it was clear to all that there was a lot of commonsense to code in, although few could have predicted that Lenat would persevere at it for over 30 years.

They themselves underestimated the difficulty. In 1990, they confidently titled a paper "Cyc: A midterm report" [@lenatCycMidtermReport1990], suggesting that they expected to be done around 1995.

The progress report in 1995 stated that, while the system is far from done, they have at least manually entered $10^5$ "general concepts" and $10^6$ "commonsense axioms" into Cyc, at the price of 100 person-years. [@lenatCycLargescaleInvestment1995]

> Moreover, statistics, colocation, and frequency do not resolve such questions. But the task goes from impossible to trivial if one already knows a few things about boxes and pens, police and demonstrators, and water and teakettles. The same sort of chicken-and-egg relationship characterizes CYC and ML because learning occurs at the fringe of what one already knows. Therefore, in the early 1980s, when the rest of the world was so enthusiastic about Natural Language Understanding, Machine Learning, and AI in general, we were pessimistic. We concluded the only way out of this codependency would be to prime the pump by manually crafting a million axioms covering an appreciable fraction of the required knowledge. That knowledge would serve as a critical mass, enabling further knowledge collection through NLU and ML, beginning in the mid-1990s. Mary Shepherd and I embarked on that task in 1984, knowing we had little chance of success, but seeing no alternative but to try... we are now moving toward the transition point where NLU and ML are supported. The rest of the world is disillusioned and pessimistic about symbolic AI, but ironically, as CYC reaches closure, our hopes for NLU and ML in the next 10 years are very high.
>
> [@lenatCycLargescaleInvestment1995]

Cycorp regarded the semantic web effort as doing essentially the same thing, except with a less expressive frame language (like Java objects) on a much larger scale. During the 2000s, papers from Cycorp often talked of integrating Cyc with the semantic web by encoding knowledge in RDF, OWL, and XML. Well, in a sense, the Semantic Web did arrive, but instead of the dream of Cyc-like thinkers performing long queries over databases, we have forgetful agent swarms talking with each other with API calls, dying, [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)ing, and reincarnating, a game of [*Memento*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) on the global scale.

> ... give CYC enough knowledge by the late 1990s to enable it to learn more by means of natural language conversations and reading. Soon thereafter, say by 2001, we planned to have it learning on its own, by automated-discovery methods guided by models or minitheories of the real world. To a large extent, that's just what we did. At the end of 1994, the CYC program was mature enough to spin off from MCC as a new company -- Cycorp -- to commercialize the technology and begin its widespread deployment.

In 2016, Lenat finally declared the Cyc project "done" and set about commercializing it.

> Having spent the past 31 years memorizing an astonishing collection of general knowledge, the artificial-intelligence engine created by Doug Lenat is finally ready to go to work... most of what is left to be added is relevant to a specific area of expertise, such as finance or oncology.

That was essentially the last we heard from Cyc.

When looking at this figure from 1985, one is simultaneously filled with respect and sadness, for they were facing impossible odds, and yet they charged right into it.

![[@lenatCycUsingCommon1985, Figure 1]](figure/cyc_project_ontology.png)

Their "midterm report" only accentuates this sense of tragedy, of seeing them fighting impossible odds, and losing. They saw with clarity that there is no shortcut to intelligence, no "Maxwell's equations of thought".

> The majority of work in knowledge representation has dealt with the technicalities of relating predicate calculus to other formalisms and with the details of various schemes for default reasoning. There has almost been an aversion to addressing the problems that arise in actually representing large bodies of knowledge with content. However, deep, important issues must be addressed if we are to ever have a large intelligent knowledge-based program: What ontological categories would make up an adequate set for carving up the universe? How are they related? What are the important facts and heuristics most humans today know about solid objects? And so on. In short, we must bite the bullet.

Perhaps the hardest truth to face, one that AI has been trying to wriggle out of for 34 years, is that there is probably no elegant, effortless way to obtain this immense knowledge base. Rather, the bulk of the effort must (at least initially) be manual entry of assertion after assertion.

OpenCyc quietly shut down with no fanfare, probably in 2017-03, with a [curt message](https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212642/http://opencyc.org/):

> Part of the Cyc technology was released, starting in 2001, as OpenCyc, which provided an API, RDF endpoint, and data dump, under appropriate Apache and Creative Commons open source licenses. Its distribution was discontinued in early 2017 because such "fragmenting" led to divergence, and led to confusion amongst its users and the technical community generally that that OpenCyc fragment was Cyc.

The programs were written in "[SubLisp](https://cyc.com/archives/glossary/subl/)", a variant of [Allegro Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro_Common_Lisp), which is then compiled to Java.

As you may know at this point, the military is behind everything in AI, and that includes the Cyc project. The Cyc project started in 1984-07 under the [Microelectronics and Computer Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics_and_Computer_Technology_Corporation), which, like SCI, was formed in reaction to the Japanese FGCS. Though it was not *directly* funded by the government, its head was [Bobby Inman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Ray_Inman), who held high positions in the Navy, the NSA, and the CIA, so...

In 1995-01, they left the MCC to continue development in Cycorp Inc., a for-profit company. Playing its part, academic publication almost immediately ceased after that point.[^cyberstalking-the-cyc]

[^cyberstalking-the-cyc]: Most papers published after that point were slim on details, and mostly about yet new exciting ways for them to ingest more data from the Internet, or about yet more ways to use their knowledge base. I could find no information about how the inference engines worked, or details of the CycL. Most of the "applications" were vaporware, with dead links everywhere. I basically resorted to cyberstalking, tracking down every Lenat talk and news report over the years, and digging up gossips by ex-Cyclists, to piece together what happened afterwards.

Who bought the services of Cyc and for what? The details are slim. Trade secrets, no doubt. Confirmed results:[^policy-wonk]

Looking at the list, it is obvious that much of Cycorp funding came from the American intelligence community, especially between 2001 and 2010, during the heights of [War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror), as the American state struggled to expand its sovereign eye over the expanding cyberspace. Indeed, one of the early success was when it "predicted anthrax might be sent through the mail six months before trove of knowledge about past terrorist activities, tactics, and weapons". Though the success did not help anyone, it was great advertisement.[@hawkinsPredictingTerroristsNext2003][^explosive-dolphins] Lenat in a [2006 Google Talk](https://youtu.be/gAtn-4fhuWA?si=gAQ-TISZxxgeD1VN&t=1856) showed screenshots of Cyc answering "Which American city would be most vulnerable to an anthrax attack during summer?". (The answer was "Phoenix".)

    But there's also this:

    > Once, developing a scenario for a terrorist attack on Hoover Dam, it hypothesized a school of 1,000 al Qaeda-trained dolphins bearing explosives. [@hawkinsPredictingTerroristsNext2003]

The total funding of the project is hard to know, although we know that in 2002, its [total cost had been \$60M](https://stanfordmag.org/contents/wise-up-dumb-machine), of which [\$25M came from the military](https://web.archive.org/web/20120502151103/http://www.opencyc.org/cyc/company/news/APArticle060902), so I think it's fair to say 50\% came from the military.

While there were some partial open sources, Cyc is fundamentally a proprietary system since its inception. Academic publications were few; most publications became advertisements ($\sim 10^6 \mathrm{\mu Lenat/pub}); OpenCyc shut down in 2017; 

Eventually, . The general inference engine had been long turned off, and the Cyc system was a mass of over 1000 little inference engines. [@lenatGettingGenerativeAI2023]

> He divided the universe in forty categories or classes, these being further subdivided into differences, which was then subdivided into species. He assigned to each class a monosyllable of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example: `de`, which means an element; `deb`, the first of the elements, fire; `deba`, a part of the element fire, a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850) `a` means animal; `ab`, mammal; `abo`, carnivore; `aboj`, feline; `aboje`, cat; `abi`, herbivore; `abiv`, horse; etc... children would be able to learn this language without knowing it be artificial; afterwards, at school, they would discover it being an universal code and a secret encyclopaedia.

> Once we have defined Wilkins' procedure, it is time to examine a problem which could be impossible or at least difficult to postpone: the value of this four-level table which is the base of the language. Let us consider the eighth category, the category of stones. Wilkins divides them into common (silica, gravel, schist), modics (marble, amber, coral), precious (pearl, opal), transparent (amethyst, sapphire) and insolubles (chalk, arsenic). Almost as surprising as the eighth, is the ninth category. This one reveals to us that metals can be imperfect (cinnabar, mercury), artificial (bronze, brass), recremental (filings, rust) and natural (gold, tin, copper). Beauty belongs to the sixteenth category; it is a living brood fish, an oblong one.

Lenat is the very example of a [hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox): a single vision for AGI, pursued for 40 years. One does not pursue a single vision without rejecting alternative visions, and Lenat has been explicit in rejecting every alternative route to AGI, and he had a sharp tongue [@thompsonKnowItAllMachine2001; @lenatVoiceTurtleWhatever2008; @lenatGettingGenerativeAI2023]:

* Logical AI in the style of Simon and Newell's General Problem Solver. Such an elegant framework would not work beyond toy problem domains, since there are no "Maxwell's Equations of Thought" from which knowledge can be computed.
* Highly accurate models of human behavior, in the style of Simon and Newell's *Human Problem Solving*. Duplicating human cognitive architecture constitutes cargo cult science. AGI need not have the [magic number 7 ± 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven%2C_Plus_or_Minus_Two).
* Physical embodiment. It might be great fun to make robots, but physical embodiment is neither necessary nor sufficient for "grounding" the knowledge base. Such a "mystical worship of physical embodiment" would only delay AGI.
* Genetic algorithms and other evolutionary algorithms. It gets stuck in local minima too often, and runs too slowly.
* Creating tiny morsels of little expert systems, and hope that bit by bit, AGI would emerge out of that. Without an overarching plan, they will not fit together, like how the 1980s expert systems could never talk to each other. Similarly, the [subsumption architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture) does not lead to AGI either.
* Logical machine learning without a large knowledge base already in place. It makes for good demos, but quickly exhausts itself. These are examples of the illusory hope for "free lunch" or elegant "Maxwell's equations of thinking", a severe case of laziness and "physics envy". Researchers should stop sitting on their asses mad with "physics evny", and start the dirty work of coding.
* Statistical machine learning, pattern matching, and neural networks. Just wait for enough compute and data, then magically a large model would learn on its own? Yet more wishful thinking for "free lunch", caused by laziness and "physics envy".
* Any form of machine learning without a large knowledge base to begin with. This is impossible because learning is possible only at the fringe of knowing. Any attempt to learn without a large starting knowledge base is, again, trying to get a "free lunch".
* Wait until philosophers have figured out the one true ontology for the world, then build the Cyc accordingly. Philosophers suffered from "Hamlet syndrome", unwilling to take decisive action, satisfied with publishing tiny morsels of ontologies that don't cover the whole world, or grand ontologies that cover a caricature of the whole world.

More than philosophical and personal conviction is on the line: If Cyc really would take 1000 person-years (20 years with 50 philosopher PhDs), then it would cost about \$100 million just in human labor. The Cycorp, if it were to survive, has a strong commercial interest in rejecting all alternatives. It can be very hard to understand something, when misunderstanding it is essential to your [product differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_differentiation).

Lenat's rejections progressed with time as each new challenger arose. In the 1980s, like other expert systems people, he focussed his rejection towards the previous logical AI methods exemplified by Simon and Newell. Logical AI was a dream that a graduate student might build an AGI during a thesis period, if only they knew the "Maxwell's equations of thinking". He took a little effort towards rejecting the *other* logical AI approach, that of *Human Problem Solving*, constructing models that reproduced every little detail of how humans really perform in psychometric experiments, such as their reaction times. Admitting its interest to psychologists, he considered it a distraction for machine intelligence.

In the 1990s, as the expert system hype died down, he turned his criticism towards expert systems. He recalled that, back when he was young, before academia had rejected him, he thought automated discovery with AI, such as AM and Eurisko, would lead the way to self-improving learning machines. But then he was disabused of this. Bacon discovered Kepler's three laws "only" from data, but that's because Pat Langley was careful in presenting nothing but the data necessary for this. The cost to discover Kepler's laws on the filtered dataset? A few CPU-hours. The cost to filter the dataset? 10 Kepler-years. Similarly, AM started out with the set-theory axioms and discovered prime numbers and some famous conjectures, but quickly ended up enumerating boring complications. Lenat had to keep adding in more heuristics to get something out of it. Similarly, Eurisko would run overnight and Lenat would check its outputs in the morning, remove some bad ideas, add some good ones, and so on. Lenat estimated that the Travellers 1981 win was "60/40% Lenat/Eurisko" [@lenatEuriskoProgramThat1983].

Generalizing, Lenat argued that there is a common thread across all these machine learning systems. They would all start out discovering many interesting basic things, but quickly "run out of steam" enumerating boring complications. Lenat called it having a "veneer of intelligence", but were really just "discharging potential energy that was stored in them". That is, the creators secretly put into the program with their own expert knowledge somehow, either through the right rules, heuristics, dataset, features, or some other thing. Once the expert knowledge is "exhausted", no more discoveries could be made. However, it makes for impressive demos, leading to hype-and-disappointment cycles. The only escape is to prime the knowledge pump. If the knowledge base is large enough, then it wouldn't run out of steam. [@lenatVoiceTurtleWhatever2008]

Lenat's approach was unwelcome from the academics, and the feeling was mutual. AI researchers thought the Cyc project was hyped, and was unhappy with the secretive nature of Cycorp. Philosophers considered the Cyc project premature -- how could Lenat build an ontology for the world when philosophers haven't even figured out what the ontology is? Lenat shot back, calling academics lazy, abstract, and unable to persist through decades of hard engineering work. [@thompsonKnowItAllMachine2001] Among the academics, the only one that still supported him was Marvin Minsky, who had no problem calling the rest of AI research "brain-dead since the 1970s", especially robotics: "Graduate students are wasting 3 years of their lives soldering and repairing robots, instead of making them smart.". [@baardAIFounderBlasts2003]

During this period, there were two main challengers to his idea of a monolithic logical system. On the one side, there was the challenge of bottom-up non-symbolic reasoning promoted by Rodney Brooks' subsumption architecture [@brooksElephantsDonPlay1990], and the statistical machine learning methods like support vector machines. He did not have much to say about the statistical methods -- not yet -- but he did reject the subsumption architecture as a mistaken attempt to reach AGI through robotics, much as Minsky did. Motors, sensors, etc, are simply not needed -- common sense, specified in logical language, is all you need. 

Though most expert systems people have shrunk their ambition to commercial products, some still believed that we could build little systems, brick by brick, until a general system is found. This is basically a "Society of Mind" approach of Marvin Minsky, and Lenat and Minsky liked each other's research, Lenat rejected this approach as well. One cannot settle for building common sense bit by bit, expecting a finished system to emerge, but must build the whole thing in one framework. Otherwise, it will fragment into a Tower of Babel, with little expert systems of incompatible ontologies, just like how Feigenbaum's dream of a "Library of Congress" of knowledge bases failed to materialize.

In the 2000s, big data arrived with the Internet, and statistical learning became dominant. No doubt trying to preempt customers' "Why don't I just Google it?", he turned his firepower towards statistical learning systems. He never tired of pointing out that, if you make an even slightly complex query like "Is the Space Needle taller than the Eiffel Tower?", Google will happily serve up results saying "The Space Needle is 605 feet high." and "The Eiffel Tower is 1,063 feet high.", but unable to actually answer your question. Despite having 15,000 servers, Google only ran dumb statistical algorithms, while Cyc running on a single server could answer it. Google-style statistical machine learning, like its trillion-token statistical machine translations systems [@brantsLargeLanguageModels2007], was just pattern matching, yet another example of hoping for a free lunch. Such systems could not truly understand. As an alternative, he held out Cyc as the foundation to the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), which would build a system that *would* truly understand.

Though he had made no comment on neural networks in the first 30 years of Cyc, in the 2010s, with the rise of Deep Learning, he had finally directed some attention to rejecting them. In his view, neural networks are yet another form of shallow pattern matching algorithm, or statistical machine learning. Thinking that "one large net for everything" would just work is yet another example of the logical AI fallacy that "If only we have the Maxwell's equations of learning, it will just work!". They are always "remembering and espousing", but never "understanding and inferring", and can only ever be the "right brain" to Cyc's "left brain" [@lenatGettingGenerativeAI2023]. As Deep Learning kept blowing past expectations, his warnings became more apocalyptic:

> They may be otherwise quite smart and charming (such as Raymond in *Rain Man* and Chauncey Gardiner in *Being There*), but it would be frankly dangerous to let them drive your car, mind your baby, cook your meals, act as your physician, manage your money, etc. And yet those are the very applications the world is blithely handing over to severely autistic AI programs!

> We would not be comfortable giving a severely neurologically-impaired person -- say someone with no functioning left brain hemisphere -- real-time decision-making authority over our family members' health, our life savings, our cars, or our missile defense systems. Yet we are hurtling in that direction with today’s AI's which are impaired in almost exactly that same fashion! They -- those people and those AI programs -- have trouble doing multi-step abstract reasoning, and that limitation makes their decision-making and behavior brittle, especially when confronted by unfamiliar, unexpected and unusual situations... Machine learning algorithms have scarcely changed at all, in the last 40 years... Current AI’s can form and recognize patterns, but they don’t really *understand* anything. That’s what we humans use our left brain hemispheres for.

Researchers and application builders tolerate their AI systems having just the thinnest veneer of intelligence, and that may be adequate for fast internet searching or party conversation or New York Times op-ed pieces, but that simple representation leads to inferences and answers which fall far short of the levels of competence and insight and adaptability that expert humans routinely achieve at complicated tasks, and leads to shallow explanations and justifications of those answers. There is a way out of that trap, though it’s not pleasant or elegant or easy. The solution is not a machine-learning-like “free lunch” or one clap-of-thunder insight about a clever algorithm: it requires a lot of hard work...

The same accusation of brain-damage that he leveled at neural networks was in fact a rehash of the exact same argument he made against statistical machine learning systems in the 2000s like Cleverbot, Google, and Amazon recommender systems[@loveMostAmbitiousArtificial2014], since he made no distinction between statistical methods, be it keyword matching, n-gram models, or neural networks. They are all the same veneer of intelligence, same free lunch, same shallowness.[^hedgehogs-are-all-the-same]

[^hedgehogs-are-all-the-same]:
    Hedgehogs are all the same. They have one big idea and continue going on with it for decades. Chomsky did it, Minsky did it, and Lenat did it too. Benefit: If they got it right, they really got it right. Cost: If they got it wrong, then they would sound like a broken record. For example, Lenat called expert systems "brittle" and "idiot savants" in the 1980s, and statistical machine learning systems "brittle" (probably also "idiot savant") in the 2000s, and neural networks "brittle" and "autistic" in the 2010s until his death.

    Not just his arguments are repetitive, but also his "war stories". In 1994, Cyc could retrieve images by semantic search, so that it would retrieve an image of a rockclimber if queried "an adventurous man" [@lenatArtificialIntelligence1995]. He would harp on this throughout the 2000s, presumably to product-differentiate against Google-like Image Search engines. Similarly, he first told of a story of an expert system diagnosing his rusty car with measles in 1987 [@lenatThresholdsKnowledge1991], and would keep telling that story throughout the 2000s. Similarly, he kept talking about the Winograd schema challenge, and how logically encoded common sense is the only way to solve it. Etc.
    
    Indeed, it is easy for Lenat to *prove* that all these systems are idiot savants [@caiAmbientIntelligenceEveryday2006]:

    1. Unless common sense is fully represented and integrated, an AI system is an idiot savant at most.
    2. Machine-learning common sense is impossible because learning is possible only at the fringe of knowing.
    3. Therefore...

    Here is a list of all the keywords you need to detect Lenat-propaganda ($\sim 10^7 \mathrm{\mu Lenat}$): free lunch, hard work, physics envy, Maxwell's equations, clever algorithm, measles, idiot-savant/autistic, veneer of intelligence, shallow, pattern matching, brittle, understand, trustworthy, left brain, hemisphere.

In his last paper, coauthored with Gary Marcus, he and updated his critique of statistical machine learning to the LLM age. Again the brittleness, free lunch, etc. [@lenatGettingGenerativeAI2023] I am struck by the irony that a veteran of logical AI would call neural networks "brittle", or make an appeal to sunk cost. Lenat had devoted 2000 person-years to the project, therefore a "free lunch" shouldn't work, nevermind the fact that these "free" lunches [cost \$100 million](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/) per serving, roughly the total budget of Cycorp through its life... But *de mortuis nil nisi bonum*.

Lenat died in 2023. His passing was unmourned on [Lucid AI](https://lucid.ai/) and [Cycorp](https://cyc.com/), who, like [ABBYY](TODO), still proudly advertise their market differentiation,[^cyc-white-paper] that true AI needs both the left brain and the right brain, and they sell the finest left brains on the planet.

Calling it "**A**ctually **I**ntelligent", claiming "ML can *never* give an explicit step-by-step explanation of its line of reasoning behind a conclusion, but Cyc *always* can." And insinuating that *nobody* could do Natural Language Understanding yet because none of those newfangled neural networks had any pragmatics... And this was uploaded in 2021-04, a year after GPT-3!
