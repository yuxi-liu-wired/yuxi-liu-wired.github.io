> The question you raise “how can such a formulation lead to computations” doesn’t bother me in the least! Throughout my whole life as a mathematician, the possibility of making explicit, elegant computations has always come out by itself, as a byproduct of a thorough conceptual understanding of what was going on. Thus I never bothered about whether what would come out would be suitable for this or that, but just tried to understand – and it always turned out that understanding was all that mattered.

What is light? Newton said it was a particle[^newton-particle]. Huygens said it was a wave. Schrödinger said it was both. Some clever fool said it was a *wavicle*. And Feynman said it was whatever ~~helps you sleep at night~~ shuts you up and lets you calculate.

[^newton-particle]: As stated in his *Opticks*, \"Every source of light emits large numbers of tiny particles known as corpuscles in a medium surrounding the source. These corpuscles are perfectly elastic, rigid, and weightless.\"

So is light a particle, or a wave? None of these explanations satisfied me, so I figured it out for myself.

### Basic definitions

- A **noumenon** is the real thing.[^noumenon]


[^noumenon]: Don't get too attached to the noumenon. We'll kill it soon enough.

- A **phenomenon** or an **observation** is an approximation of the noumenon that we are able to describe mathematically.[^minds-are-mathematical]
- A phenomenon can either be **physical** or **unphysical**. A physical phenomenon can be observed, while an unphysical phenomenon cannot be observed.
- A **physical theory** (or a **phenomenology**) is a function of type $$T: \verb|Phenomena|_T \to \verb|{physical, unphysical}|$$ That is, a physical theory asserts that some phenomena in $\verb|Phenomena|_T$ are physical, some others are unphysical. It remains silent on phenomena outside of $\verb|Phenomena|_T$. We say that $T$ **decides** about a phenomenon $p$ iff $p\in \verb|Phenomena|_T$.
- The **domain** of a physical theory $T$ is $\verb|Phenomena|_T$, the set of phenomena that it decides.
- An **interpretation** of theory $T$ is a function $$I: \verb|Phenomena|_T \to X$$ where $X$ is some other set that is easier to describe mathematically than $\verb|Phenomena|_T$.
- An **interpreted** physical theory $T$ is a decomposition of $T$ into two parts: $$T: \verb|Phenomena|_T \xrightarrow[]{I} X \xrightarrow[]{T_I} \verb|{physical, unphysical}|$$ where $T$ is the \"theory being interpreted\", $I$ is the \"interpretation\", and $T_I$ is the \"interpreted theory\".

[^minds-are-mathematical]: We assume that minds are mathematical. That is, if it cannot be described mathematically, then it cannot appear as anything to us. We cannot see it, smell it, touch it, or interact with it in any observable way.

For example, a **theory of everything** is a function of type $$\verb|Phenomena| \to \verb|{physical, unphysical}|$$ That is, it is a physical theory with domain over all phenomena.

Pythagoreanism, or its modern version as Max Tegmark's mathematical universe hypothesis, states simply that the noumenon is a mathematical object too, like every other phenomenon.

### Geometric physical theory

A **geometric physical theory** is a physical theory whose domain consists of certain functions[^nice-functions] between certain manifolds.

[^nice-functions]: We usually only allow \"nice\" functions, that is, functions that are smooth, or analytical (expressible as a Taylor series), or Fourier-transformable, or whatever. Just assume it is nice enough, charge, win glory, and let the analysts clean up the battle field.

Given a geometric physical theory, if there is a manifold $\mathcal M$ that plays a central role in the theory, then we call the manifold its **physical space**. Most geometric physical theories have a physical space, but some physical theories don't actually have a unique physical space, since they are more \"egalitarian\" and do not crown any particular manifold with the great title of \"*the* physical space\".

For example, if we want to describe the motion of three constant point masses under gravitational attraction, then we can take $\mathcal M = \R^{1 + 3 + 3 + 3}$, with 3 dimensions for each particle's position, and 1 dimension for time.

Newtonian mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, special relativity, etc are all geometric physical theories. Much more will be said about this, but for now, let's turn to another contender to a theory of everything\...

### Digital physical theory

A **digital physical theory** is a physical theory that can be interpreted as a theory over Turing machines, or cellular automata, or some other class of discrete mathematical objects.

Consider the following digital theory of everything: Our universe is a Turing machine with a certain rule-set (the exact rule-set omitted for space), over an infinite tape that starts out with all zeros. This theory predicts that certain patterns of zeros and ones could appear on the tape, while others cannot. It is silent about other phenomena, such as twos, threes, or non-Turing-machines.

Since we do not actually observe Turing machines, or infinite tapes, or zeros and ones, this is not a physical theory, but an interpretation of a physical theory. We can use this interpretation by an **interpretation function**: $$I: \verb|Phenomena| \to \verb|Events about the Turing machine|$$ For example, we might interpret the phenomenon \"I saw a particle move from here to there\" as \"a cluster of ones on the tape, about 100-digit-long, moved from location 1000 to location 2000 after 10000 steps of the Turing machine\".

With that, we can finally get a hold of the actual physical theory: $$T: \verb|Phenomena| \xrightarrow[]{I} \verb|Events about the Turing machine| \xrightarrow[]{T'} \verb|{physical, unphysical}|$$ where $T$ is the physical theory, and $T'$ is \"Let $TM$ be a Turing machine with the following rule-set (omitted). An event is physical iff the event actually occurs if $TM$ begins operation on an infinite tape of all zeros.\".

### Equivalent interpretations

The key astonishing fact in theoretical computer science is that there are many apparently different definitions of \"computability\" that are actually equivalent. For example, Turing machines, partial recursive functions, tag systems, etc, all define the same computable functions. See Figure [1](#fig:computational_equivalence){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:computational_equivalence"}.

![The theory of computability and its many equivalent interpretations.](images/computational_equivalence.png){#fig:computational_equivalence width="\\textwidth"}

We explain a few examples in the diagram.

Turing Machine, general recursive functions, Wang tiles, etc.

### Mathematics without foundations

::: epigraph Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.

W. B. Yeats, *The Second Coming* :::

In the figure for the theory of computability, there is a physical theory of the phenomenon, such that all others are merely its interpretations. Only a partial function of type $\N \to \N$ is a phenomenon, and only they can be computable or non-computable. A stream of binary colorings on $\Z$ is not a phenomenon, but merely a representation of the phenomenon. The theory of Turing-computability is merely an interpreted version of the physical theory.

What happens if we erase the distinction between phenomena and equivalent representations of phenomena? Then we will have decentered computability theory, as shown in Figure [2](#fig:computational_equivalence_decentered){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:computational_equivalence_decentered"}.

We say that we have **decentered** a physical theory, when we refuse to recognize a distinction between $\verb|Phenomena|$ and its equivalent interpretations. That is, every equivalent interpretation is equally valid.

![The theory of computability, decentered.](images/computational_equivalence_decentered.png){#fig:computational_equivalence_decentered width="\\textwidth"}

General mathematicians don't care much about the foundation. Currently there is a feeling that anything that has been worked on for a long time is sound. Mathematics is now seen as a massive graph of math-nuggets that connect to each other, floating in a vacuum with no special nuggets considered as \"the true foundation\".

However, this does not mean that all math-nuggets are equally significant, or foundation-worthy. Generally, significance is measured by these characteristics[^nugget-significance]:

[^nugget-significance]: For a good discussion of what makes a nugget \"significant\", read Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology, starting at section 11.

- How densely a nugget is connected to other nuggets;
- How \"deep\" the connections are;
- How fashionable it is (synthetic geometry is not fashionable now, but was extremely fashionable 2000 years ago);
- How close to physical reality it is (this makes basic calculus more significant than theory of prime numbers).

As for foundation-worthiness, [@maddyWhatWeWant2019] is a great place to learn about the details. I think that in short, some nuggets are better suited for foundation if they satisfy the following criteria:

* Can encode the things that mathematicians want to work with. This is analogous to a programming language being \"Turing complete\". A foundation must be \"mathematician complete\" or get close to it.
* Can encode elegantly. This is less objective but also very important. In the algebraic-flavored fields, category theory wins over set theory in this aspect.
* Can be checked mechanically, that is, it is good for formal verification. This is not yet a very important consideration, but is something univalent foundations and other type-theory foundations are explicitly trying to do well.

The world is a network of theories. An interpretation is an arrow from one theory to another. There is nothing beyond the network of theories and their interpretations.

## The wave-particle duality

There are more than one wave-particle duality. In fact, there is nothing particularly two-ful or wave-ful or particle-ful about physics! Why are we so confused about wave-particle duality? I blame force of habit and evolution.

- A **particle** is a curve. That is, it is a function $\gamma: (a, b) \to \mathcal M$, where $a < b$ are real numbers, and $\mathcal M$ is a manifold.

- A field is a function $\phi: \mathcal M \to Y$, where $Y$ is any manifold you like. We say the field is $Y$-valued.

- A **scalar field** is a real-valued field.

- A **wave** is a more confusing name for a field. Why \"confusing\"? Because the word \"wave\" makes people think the field must be \"going up and down\" here, there, or everywhere, but the fact is, a field can be exactly flat everywhere, and still be a wave! So why did physicists call it a \"wave\" when they really mean a field? Well, force of habit\... back in the old days, the only field they knew of is the water-wave, which can be described mathematically as $h: \R^2 \to \R$, where $h(x)$ is the height of water at location $x$.

- A **particle theory** over a manifold $\mathcal M$ is a physical theory that states that certain paths in $\mathcal M$ are \"physical\" while others are \"unphysical\".

- A **field theory** over a manifold $\mathcal M$ is a physical theory that states that certain fields over $\mathcal M$ are \"physical\" while others are \"unphysical\".

- A **wave theory** is a field theory.

- A **wave-particle duality** over a manifold $\mathcal M$ is a tuple $(T, T', f)$. Here, $T$ is a particle theory over $\mathcal M$, and $T'$ is a field theory over $\mathcal M$, and $f$ is an equivalence between $T, T'$.

- A **wave-equation** is a differential equation satisfied by a field.

- An **equation of motion (of a particle)** is a differential equation satisfied by a particle.

If our physical theory has a very special \"physical space\" $\mathcal M$, then a particle is a function $\gamma: (a, b) \to \R\times \mathcal M$, where $a < b$ are real numbers, and $\R$ represents time. In other words, a particle is nothing more and nothing less than a trajectory in spacetime. This is what we mean by a \"particle\" by default, even though sometimes we would deal with \"timeless particles\", for which time is meaningless, and a particle must instead be a function $\gamma: (a, b) \to \mathcal M$.

Timeless particles? Why yes! That's how we study geometric optics as the study of light-rays.

### In geometric optics

### In Hamiltonian mechanics

### In quantum mechanics

## Crash course in modern theoretical physics

Recall that a particle is a function $\gamma: (a, b) \to \R\times \mathcal M$. But what if we don't use an interval $(a, b)$, but use a square, or a cylinder, or even a cube? This leads us to the idea of strings, branes, and other such fancy frontiers of theoretical physics.

### String theory

A **closed string** is a function $\mu: (a, b) \times \mathbb S^1 \to \mathcal M$, where $a < b$ are real numbers, and $\mathbb S^1$ is the circle.

An **open string** is a function $\mu: (a, b) \times (0, 1)\to \mathcal M$, where $a < b$ are real numbers.

A **string theory** is made of two parts: one, the types of strings that it decides about; two, a way to decide if a string is physical or unphysical.

### How to make your own variational physical theory

1. Find a manifold $\mathcal A$.

2. Find another manifold $\mathcal B$.

3. Define a family of functions of type $\mu: \mathcal A \to \mathcal B$. This will be the domain of your physical theory.

4. Write down an action function $S(\mu)$.

5. Specify a way to \"vary $\mu$ infinitesimally\". Write that as $\delta$.

6. Derive consequences of $$\delta S(\mu) = 0.$$

Following the recipe, we immediately get Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.

Now, we made a small sleight of hand in the recipe. Can you spot it? It is in steps 4 and 5. Namely, we have claimed that we can \"write down an action function\" and \"vary $\mu$ infinitesimally\". However, not every $\mathcal A, \mathcal B$ has enough structure to allow us to do that. The art of doing theoretical physics is mostly in putting in enough structure in $\mathcal A, \mathcal B$ so that you can define $S(\mu)$ and $\delta S(\mu)$.

### How to clothe your manifolds

::: epigraph The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.

Hannah Arendt, *The origins of totalitarianism* :::

Since a mere manifold is not structured enough for defining actions and infinitesimal variations, we will \"clothe\" the manifolds with enough structures so that they do. To make this concrete, we will consider how we could construct Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics according to the recipe.

Lagrangian

Hamiltonian

And if you go deep into theoretical physics, you will eventually encounter Calabi--Yau manifolds, which are \"compact Kähler manifolds with a vanishing first Chern class and a Ricci-flat metric\". All these extra structures give them enough theoretical niceness for elegant string theories.

### Exercise for the reader

Apply the recipe to your favorite manifolds, and get it published in a journal of physics with an impact factor of at least 2.
