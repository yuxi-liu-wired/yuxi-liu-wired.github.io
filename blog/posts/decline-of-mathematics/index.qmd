## Invariant Theory

> In the 1880's and 90's the Theory of Invariants was seen to have unified many areas of mathematics, but by 1940 mathematicians, if asked, would have said the theory was dead. ... most contemporary mathematicians have difficulty in naming one practitioner of the theory.

> Invariant theory has already been pronounced dead several times, and like the phoenix it has been again and again rising from its ashes. The first period in the history of the theory culminated with the discovery of the so-called “symbolic method” which in theory allowed the computation of all invariants by a quasi-mechanical process, But it was soon realized that, except in a very few simple cases, the actual computation would lead to enormous labor, disproportionate with the interest of the outcome, especially in a period when all calculations were done by hand (it might be worthwhile to push the XIXth Century computations of invariants a little further along, with the help of modern computers). Partly for that reason, the next problem in the theory was the search for “fundamental systems” of invariants, i.e., finite sets such that any invariant would be a polynomial in the fundamental invariants. It is well known that the existence of such systems was proved by Hilbert in 1890, in a brilliant paper which made him famous overnight and which may be considered as the first paper in “modern algebra,” by its conceptual approach and methods. But Hilbert’s success also spelled the doom of XIXth Century invariant theory, which was left with no big problems to solve and soon faded into oblivion.

> Hilbert’s paper did not immediately kill the subject, but rather acted as a progressive illness, beginning with an initial shock, and slowly consuming the computational body of the theory from within, so that by the early 1920’s the subject was clearly moribund. Abstraction ruled: the disciples of Emmy Noether, a student of Gordan, led the fight against the discredited computational empire, perhaps as a reaction to Noether’s original, onerous thesis topic that involved computing the invariants for a quartic form in three variables.

### Basic setup

Consider all degree-2 homogeneous polynomials (over complex numbers). That is, consider functions like

$$
f(z) = a_1 z_1^2 + a_2 z_1z_2 + a_3 z_2^2, \quad a_1, a_2, a_3 \in \C.
$$

Each such polynomial $f$ is equivalent to a point in $\C^3$. As usual, we always try to hit the function with linear transforms if it simplifies the function. Let $A$ be a linear transform, such that

$$
A(z_1, z_2) = (A_{11}z_1 + A_{12}z_2, A_{21}z_1 + A_{22}z_2)
$$

It would not do if $A$ collapses everything to zero, so we require $A$ to be invertible. Further, we are only interested in solving $f=0$, not the value of $f$ itself. Therefore, scaling $A$ by a constant does not matter, so we can remove this ambiguity by requiring $\det A = 1$. That is, we only consider the group $SL(2)$.

In fact, we are not considering the whole space $\C^3$, but only the space of lines -- the projective plane $\P\C^2$. The idea can be visualized in real space $\R^3$ by first taking a homogeneous polynomial's solutions can be found by first solving it on the unit sphere, then zoom it in and out to get all the whole solution.

For example, if we have a polynomial $f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^2z + 2xyz$, then its solution $f=0$ is a surface in $\R^3$. We can solve the problem by first solving the surface's intersection with the unit sphere, then for each point on the intersection, drawing a ray from the origin to the point. You can picture it thus: Take a steel ball, draw a curve on the surface with a marker pen, then drill in at each point on the curve, resulting in a cut-out cone.

![Rings of a tree. You can solve a polynomial by finding the intersection of the surface with the bark of the tree, then draw a line from the center to each point.](figure/tree-ring.jpg)

Theorem: Any invariant of $f$ is divisible by the discriminant $\Delta = a_2^2 - 4a_1a_3$.

Hilbert's basis theorem: For any form of polynomial, the space of invariants has a finite basis.
