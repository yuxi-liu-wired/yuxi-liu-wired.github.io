Those are called the \"coordinate systems\".\n* You can go from one coordinate system to another by a coordinate transform. Transforms can be combined one after another, and they can be reversed. That is, they make up a group, named the symmetry group of spacetime.\n* The symmetry group is smooth and connected, meaning that starting with the identity transformation (doing nothing), you can combine it with tiny transformations, and end up at any other transformation.\n\n[^shaped-like]: In jargon, it is isomorphic as a smooth manifold to $\\R^{n+1}$, or diffeomorphic to $\\R^{n+1}$.\n\nWe will follow the spirit of Erlangen program, which states clearly what our target is [@kleinComparativeReviewRecent1893]:\n\n> Given a manifoldness [smooth space] and a group of transformations of the same; to develop the theory of invariants relating to that group. This is the general problem, and it comprehends not alone ordinary geometry, but also and in particular the more recent geometrical theories which we propose to discuss, and the different methods of treating manifoldnesses of $n$ dimensions.\n\nConsidering that Felix Klein first stated it in 1872, decades before special relativity, this is prescient.\n\nApplied to special relativity, our target is to start with the axioms, find out something about what kinds of symmetries there can be, and what kinds of objects are unchanged by symmetries. In other words, we will study the geometry of spacetime.\n\n### Physics and mathematics\n\nSo far, while we were talking about \"spacetime\", we were actually talking about mathematical objects. There is no necessary connection between the mathematical objects and whatever we observe in the real world. So why do we call those mathematical objects with physically suggestive names like \"spacetime\"?\n\nWell, special relativity is really a mathematical object. It is connected to the physical world like all objects in mathematical physics: by experiments. Experimental data is physical, and by studying the mathematical-object special relativity, we found that it can generate the experimental data with a minimal amount of \"glue\" between the physical world and the mathematical world. The \"glue\" looks like:\n\n* Physical events in physical spacetime are mathematical points in mathematical spacetime.\n* Physical light moves at the mathematical speed of $c$\n* Physical clocks tick at a mathematical constant rate.\n* If you move a physical clock from physical-here to physical-there, it is still ticking at the same mathematical constant rate.\n* ...\n\nIndeed, Einstein himself discussed this physical-mathematical correspondence carefully in *The Meaning of Relativity* [@einsteinMeaningRelativityFour1922], which goes into considerable details into things like clock synchronization, moving meter-sticks around, etc.\n\n> As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\n\n## Relativity in 1+1 dimensions\n\n### Making one coordinate system\n\nTo begin, let's consider relativity in 1+1 dimensions. We will start with a \"default\" coordinate system (\"the rest frame\").\n\nIn the beginning was just a point in spacetime. We call this the origin, and write its coordinates as $x=0, t=0$. The world was yet without form. To give it form, we build a meter stick and an infinite number of light bulbs.\n\nWe put a light bulb at the origin. The light bulb traces out a path in spacetime. We call this path the $t$-axis at $x=0$.\n\nWe put another light bulb to the left of the light bulbs, separated by one meter stick. This light bulb traces out a line at $x=1$. And so on. Thus, we obtain an infinite number of lines: $\\cdots, x = -1, x = 0, x = +1, \\cdots$. By subdividing the meter stick, we obtain one line $x = r$ for each real number $r$.\n\nNow we have measured space, we will measure time. We remove all light bulbs except two: one at $x=0$, one at $x=1$. At origin, the $x=0$ light bulb flashes, and then the light bulb at $x=1$ flashes when it receives the flash. When the light bulb at $x=0$ receives the echo, this is the echo event -- and we write it down as $x=0, t=2$. Let spacetime reverberate with shining echoes, and in this way, every point in spacetime receives a unique coordinate $(x, t)$.\n\nNotice that in this construction, the fundamental speed $c$ is equal to one, and if we draw space and time as two perpendicular directions on a graph-paper, then the trajectory of every light is a 45-degree straight line on the graph-paper. These are not fundamental aspects of the theory, but are convenient outcomes given by how we constructed the coordinate system. \n\nAbstractly speaking, a coordinate system is a function that maps a point in spacetime to two real numbers, like $(x, t): \\mathcal{M} \\to \\R^{1+1}$. Our coordinate system constructed so far means that:\n\n* The origin-point $p_O$ has coordinates $x(p_O) = 0, t(p_O) = 0$.\n* If a beam of light is traveling to the right, and passes a certain point $p$, then the set of all points on the beam of light is of form $\\{q : x(q) - x(p) = t(q) - t(p)\\}$.\n* And so on.\n\nSuch explicit distinction between the spacetime itself and the coordinate system is uncommon in physics, and once you are used to it, you should throw it into your subconscious like a muscle memory. However, it is good to keep it in mind for now.\n\n### The first moving frame\n\nThe integrity of the coordinate system is based on the meter stick. If two light bulbs are moving relative to each other, then they cannot be always connected by a meter stick -- one of them would bump into the meter stick, or move away from it. In other words, the entire system is static.\n\nNow we allow another frame, moving at a velocity $v$ relative to the first. While there is no fundamental reason to privilege one over the other, we call one the \"rest frame\" and the other the \"moving frame\" for convenience.\n\n![](image)\n\nThe moving frame constructs its own coordinate system $(x', t')$. What must it look like?\n\nSince the line $x' = 0$ is constructed by the trajectory of the light bulb that passes the origin, we know that the $x' = 0$ line is $\\{p : x(p) = v t(p)\\}$. However, when it comes to the $x' = 1$ line, we have a problem: How long should be the meter stick in the moving frame be? What does it even mean to compare a meter stick in a moving frame with a meter stick in the resting frame?\n\nThis difficulty is not pedantic. In the resting frame, checking that two meter sticks are equal means taking one, accelerating it then decelerating it, until it overlaps exactly with the other. This does not apply if they are in relative motion.\n\nThe solution is another \"gluing\". Like how we \"glued\" the mathematical world with the physical world, we also glue one frame with another frame. This is [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics)), a central idea in differential geometry. However we will just do this intuitively, since in special relativity, connections are done in the most straightforward way.\n\nTo connect two frames, we divide their difference into tiny steps, and then do those tiny steps one after another. So, if we know how to connect two frames when $v$ is an infinitesimal, then we know how to connect two arbitrary frames by taking an integral.\n\nLet $v$ be an infinitesimal. What should be its meter stick? Its meter stick is whatever is necessary so that light speed is $1$ in the moving frame. So, if we know how to tick the moving clock, we know how to build the moving meter stick.\n\nIn the resting frame, the clock passing origin makes a tick at every point:\n\n$$\\cdots, (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, +1), \\cdots$$\n\nIn the moving frame, the clock passing origin makes a tick at every point: \n\n$$\\cdots, (-v \\; ?, -?), (0, 0), (v \\; ?, ?), \\cdots$$\n\nThe obvious choice is to just let $? = 1$. With this seemingly trivial step, we have in fact completely defined special relativity -- all else is derivation.\n\n### Why $? = 1$\n\nBy the smoothness axiom, if $v$ is infinitesimal, then the coordinate transform between the rest frame and the moving frame should be infinitesimally close to identity. Therefore, it should send $(0, 1)$ to $(\\delta x, 1 + \\delta t)$ for some infinitesimal $\\delta x, \\delta t$.\n\nSince special relativity does not distinguish left from right, if we were to make the moving frame move at velocity $-v$, then the coordinate transform should send $(0, 1)$ to $(-\\delta x, 1 + \\delta t)$ by mirror symmetry.\n\nNow, if we compose two boosts, first with $v$ then with $-v$, then we would send $(0, 1)$ to $(0, 1+ 2\\delta t)$. But we really should get back to $(0, 1)$ since we are back to the resting frame again. Therefore $\\delta t = 0$.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Three infinitesimal boosts](index_files/figure-html/three-infinitesimal-boosts-output-1.png){#three-infinitesimal-boosts width=484 height=481}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Lorentz transform\n\nIn the resting frame, we constructed the meter stick by shooting out one pulse of light, then listen for the echo that arrives two ticks later. The point at which the echo got reflected is one meter stick away. Equivalently, we can shoot a forward-pointing light cone at $(0, -1)$, and shoot a backward-pointing light cone at $(0, +1)$. Their intersections are the two ends of two meter sticks: $(-1, 0), (+1, 0)$.\n\nIn the boosted frame, the clock passing origin ticks at $\\cdots, (-v, -1), (0, 0), (v, 1), \\cdots$. Therefore, we can construct its meter stick in the same way, and we would find that the two light cones intersect at $(-1, -v), (+1, +v)$. This gives us the coordinate transform:\n\n$$\\forall p \\in \\mathcal{M}, \\quad \n\\begin{bmatrix} x(p) \\\\ t(p) \\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\\\ v & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} x'(p) \\\\ t'(p) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nHere we find that we need to distinguish between \"active\" and \"passive\" transforms. Everything we have said so far is \"passive\". We assumes that there is an underlying spacetime $\\mathcal{M}$, and we are to construct coordinate systems over it. The coordinate transform tells us how to turn the coordinates of *the same point* from one coordinate system to another. However, while this is often useful, it will make everything we are going to say next very awkward.\n\nTherefore, we immediately change our point of view: we are going to study \"active\" transforms from now on. While passive transform of a clock means that we have just one clock and measure its ticks in two coordinate systems, active transform of a clock means that we actually pick up the clock at rest frame, accelerate it on a rocket, and then let it glide at constant velocity at the moving frame, then study what the clock is doing *in the rest frame*.\n\nSince active transform is the opposite of passive transform, we have the active Lorentz transform formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ t' \\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\\\ v & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ t \\end{bmatrix}\n$${#eq-1d-lorentz-infinitesimal}\n\nThis formula states that if we \"pick up\" the spacetime event at $(x, t)$ in the rest frame, and accelerate it infinitesimally to speed $v$, then the spacetime event ends up at $(x', t')$ *in the rest frame*.\n\n### Integrating the Lorentz boosts\n\nSince $v$ is infinitesimal, to find the Lorentz transform for non-infinitesimal $v$ (say, $v = 10^{-100}$, which while small, is really big for an infinitesimal), we need to do an integral. \n\nBefore we do so, we should play with the discrete version: what happens if we repeatedly apply the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\\\ v & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ on the vectors $(0, 1), (1, 0)$?\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"discrete-lorentz-1d\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\"></div>\n<div  style=\"display: grid; place-items: center;\">\n<div>\n  <input type=\"range\" id=\"rSlider\" name=\"rSlider\" value=\"0.2\" min=\"0.05\" max=\"0.2\" step=\"0.05\"\n          oninput=\"document.getElementById('rValue').textContent = this.value;\" />\n  <label for=\"rSlider\">Rapidity = <span id=\"rValue\">0.05</span></label>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <input type=\"range\" id=\"lineNumberSlider\" name=\"lineNumberSlider\" value=\"1\" min=\"0\" max=\"20\" step=\"1\"\n            oninput=\"document.getElementById('lineNumberValue').textContent = this.value;\" />\n  <label for=\"lineNumberSlider\">Number of boosts = <span id=\"lineNumberValue\">1</span></label>\n</div>\n  \n<script>\nconst discreteLorentz1D = (p) => {\n    let lineLength = 100;\n    let r = 0.1;\n    let lineNumber = 20;\n\n    p.setup = function() {\n        let canvas = p.createCanvas(300, 300);\n        canvas.parent(\"discrete-lorentz-1d\");\n    };\n\n    p.draw = function() {\n        p.background(255);\n        r = parseFloat(document.getElementById('rSlider').value);\n        lineNumber = parseInt(document.getElementById('lineNumberSlider').value);\n\n        p.translate(p.width / 2, p.height / 2);\n\n        for (let i = -lineNumber; i <= lineNumber; i++) {\n            p.push();\n            if (i >= 0) {\n                for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                    p.applyMatrix(1, r, r, 1, 0, 0);\n                }\n            } else {\n                for (let j = 0; j < -i; j++) {\n                    p.applyMatrix(1, -r, -r, 1, 0, 0);\n                }\n            }\n            p.line(0, -lineLength, 0, lineLength);\n            p.line(-lineLength, 0, lineLength, 0);\n\n            p.pop();\n        }\n\n        p.line(-p.width / 2, 0, p.width / 2, 0); // x-axis\n        p.line(0, -p.height / 2, 0, p.height / 2); // y-axis\n    };\n};\n\nnew p5(discreteLorentz1D, 'discrete-lorentz-1d');\n</script>\n```\n\n\nIn the diagram, $v$ is \"rapidity\"[^rapidity-name]. We apply the Lorentz boost with the given $v$ repeatedly forwards and backwards. The resulting image is beautiful and suggestive: it looks like the unit hyperbolas!\n\n[^rapidity-name]: The reason for calling it \"rapidity\", instead of \"velocity\" would be soon clear.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/discrete_lorentz_rapidity_0.1_boosts_17.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 400px;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nHaving guessed the answer, we proceed to the explicit integral to confirm our guess.\n\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & dv \\\\ dv & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^{\\frac{v}{dv}} &= \\left(I + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\right)^{\\frac{v}{dv}}\\\\\n  &= \\exp\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} v\\right) \\\\\n  &= I + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} v + \\frac{1}{2!}v^2\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^2 + \\frac{1}{3!}v^3\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^3 + \\cdots \\\\\n  &= I(1 + v^2/2! + v^4/4! + \\cdots) + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}(v + v^3/3! + v^5/5! + \\cdots) \\\\\n  &= I\\cosh(v) + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\sinh(v)\n  \\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-1d-lorentz}\n\nAt this point, we should pause to take a careful look at $v$. While it is the same as velocity when $v$ is infinitesimal, it is not the same as velocity otherwise, because while velocity is bounded between $-1$ and $+1$, this $v$ quantity is free to vary over all real values. This is why we call it \"rapidity\" and relabel it to $w$, since it is like velocity, but different.\n\nThe velocity $v$ for a given rapidity $w$ can be found by transforming the $t$-axis using the Lorentz transform matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} \\cosh(w) & \\sinh(w) \\\\ \\sinh(w) & \\cosh(w) \\end{bmatrix}$. The $t$-axis \n$$\\{(0, s) : s \\in \\R\\}$$\nis boosted to the line\n$$\\{(\\sinh(w) s, \\cosh(w) s) : s \\in \\R\\}$$\nTherefore, the velocity of this boosted frame is \n$$w = \\sinh(w) / \\cosh(w)  = \\tanh(w).$$\n\nNow you can play with the diagram below to grow a new intuitive sense of how it all ties together. After you have grown this new intuition, you can proceed.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"clearfix\"  style=\"display: grid; place-items: center;\">\n    <div id=\"board1\" class=\"board\"></div>\n    <div id=\"board2\" class=\"board\"></div>\n</div>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./figure/2d/style.css\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./figure/2d/script.js\"></script>\n```\n\n\nA \"spacetime square\" would transform like:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n  <div class=\"diamond-sketch\" style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n### 3-velocity, 4-velocity, and inner product in spacetime\n\nIn the diagram above, we have used the terms 3-velocity and 4-velocity. To explain those terms, we briefly go back to 3+1 dimensions.\n\nWhen we say \"velocity\" informally, we mean a vector in $\\R^3$. But how is velocity really defined? It is displacement divided by time. In relativity, when we say \"3-velocity\", there are two possible representations: we can represent it as $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$, or we can represent it as $(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)$. The first is close to how the rest of the world use \"velocity\", but the second is close to how special relativity want us to use the word \"velocity\". The second representation can be interpreted as follows: \"The 3-velocity of an object is the spacetime displacement of the object after one tick of my clock.\"\n\nNeither is satisfactory, however, because 3-velocity behaves badly under Lorentz transform. The first representation $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ does not have the time-coordinate, so it can't even be multiplied with the Lorentz transform matrix. The second representation $(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)$ would, after Lorentz transform, have its time-coordinate $\\neq 1$.\n\nBoth problems are elegantly resolved if we use the 4-velocity, which means we have to divide 3-velocity by its norm... but what norm? Why, think back to the Erlangen program:\n\n> Given a manifoldness [smooth space] and a group of transformations of the same; to develop **the theory of invariants** relating to that group.\n\nIn plane geometry, we know that while $x, y, x', y'$ are geometrically meaningless, the norm-squared $(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2$ is meaningful, because that quantity is not changed (invariant) if you apply the rotation matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{bmatrix}$ to it. What would be an invariant for spacetime?\n\nWell, looking at the picture of Lorentz transform in 1+1 dimensions, we can see that it certainly looks like the intersection of the two light cones has constant area. In particular, the upper rectangle <img src=\"figure/sparkline_upper_square_shaded.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; height: 1em;\"> has constant area. That is, the quantity $(x-t)(x+t)$ is preserved.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/spacetime_diagram_1d_squeeze.gif\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nThus we define the Minkowski norm-squared: $\\|(x, t)\\|^2 := x^2 - t^2$. Note that this is not an actual square because it can be negative. However it is preserved under Lorentz transforms.\n\nOnce we have a norm-squared, we can extend it to an inner product::\n\n$$\\braket{v, w} := \\frac{\\|v+w\\|^2 - \\|v-w\\|^2}{4} = v_x w_x - v_t w_t$$\n\nwhich is still an invariant under Lorentz transforms, and thus physically meaningful. This extends in general to n+1 dimensions. For example, in 3+1 dimensions, the inner product is $\\sum_{i = x, y, z} v_i w_i - v_t w_t$.\n\nWith this, the 4-velocity is at hand! We just need to normalize $(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)$, taking care to remove the negative sign:\n\n$$\n(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)/\\sqrt{-\\|(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)\\|^2} = \\frac{(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)}{\\sqrt{1-(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}}\n$$\n\nAs an example of the power of this geometric algebra, we rederive the Lorentz transform with infinitesimal boost. In the rest frame, the unit clock-tick is the vector $(0, 1)$, and the two unit meter sticks are the vectors $(-1, 0), (1, 0)$. They are uniquely defined by the two geometric properties:\n\n$$\n\\braket{s, (0, 1)} = 0; \\braket{s, s} = 1\n$$\n\nTherefore, in the boosted frame, the boosted meter sticks are the two solutions to \n\n$$\n\\braket{s', (v, 1)} = 0; \\braket{s', s'} = 1\n$$\n\nwhich are $s' = (-1, v), (1, v)$. By continuity, $(1, 0)$ cannot have been boosted to $(-1, v)$, so it must be boosted to $(1, v)$. This gives us @eq-1d-lorentz-infinitesimal.\n\n## Relativity in 2+1 dimensions\n\n### Infinitesimal Lorentz transform\n\nIn 1+1 dimensions, we only have two spatial directions: left and right. In 2+1 dimensions, there is a whole circle of directions. We call this circle the \"space circle\", because the alternative name \"hula hoop for spacetime\" sounds too silly.\n\nJust like in 1+1 dimensions, the space circle is constructed by shooting a forward light cone at $(0, 0, -1)$ and a backward light cone at $(0, 0, +1)$. Their intersection is the space circle. A space circle plus a ticking clock together allows us to define a coordinate system with three unit vectors $(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)$. Both the clock and the space circle can be boosted. We will pick the simplest possible way to transport the ticking clock and the space circle, and experiments with [Thomas precession](#sec-thomas-precession) would show that this is the right way.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/infinitesimal_boost_2+1.png\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nSuppose we give an infinitesimal boost by $(v_x, 0)$, then by the same picture as the 1+1 dimension case, we know that the clock-tick $(0, 0, 1)$ is boosted to $(v_x, 0, 1)$, and the space circle is boosted to the ellipse with long semiaxis $(1, 0, v_x)$ and short semiaxis $(0, 1, 0)$. Where should each point on the space circle go to? Since the space circle is rigid, if we know where *one* point must go to, we know where *all* points must go to.\n\nThe semiaxis $(0, 1, 0)$ is both on the original space circle and the boosted space circle. It stands to reason that the simplest pick would preserve it after the infinitesimal boost. That is, we should not \"twist\" the space circle under boosting. With this choice, we are forced to pick $(1, 0, v_x)$ as the boosted $(1, 0, 0)$, since it is the unique unit vector that is perpendicular to $(0, 1, 0), (v_x, 0, 1)$, and infinitesimally close to $(1, 0, 0)$.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of Lorentz transform in 2+1 dimensions as the same with Lorentz transform in 1+1 dimensions, just with an extra dimension. Therefore, we can minimally modify @eq-1d-lorentz-infinitesimal to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ t' \\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ v_x & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ t \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nthe same result as our previous argument. \n\nThis extends to the case of an infinitesimal boost $(v_x, v_y)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ t' \\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\\\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\\\ v_x & v_y & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ t \\end{bmatrix}\n$${#eq-2d-lorentz-infinitesimal}\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Four ways to derive it\" collapse=\"true\" }\n1. Just guess it.\n2. Rotate the coordinate system so that the boost is in the $x$-direction, boost using the previous result, then rotate the coordinate system back. To be pedantic: We are performing one passive, then one active, then one passive transform.\n3. Take the previous derivation, and modify it by strategically inserting $v_y$ at places.\n4. Since two infinitesimal boosts do not interact except on the second-order infinitesimal, and $O(v^2) \\ll O(v) \\ll 1$, we are free to throw away the second-order infinitesimal. Therefore, we can just multiply the two matrices together to get the full thing:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ v_x & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\\\ 0 & v_y & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\\\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\\\ v_x & v_y & 1 \\end{bmatrix} + O(v^2)$$\n:::\n\n### Fermi--Walker transport\n\n@eq-2d-lorentz-infinitesimal is correct, but it is still not geometric. We must convert it with only quantities that are invariant under Lorentz transforms -- that is, the inner product.\n\nLet's replace the 4-velocity vector $(0, 0, 1)$ with simply the letter $u$, and the infinitesimal boost $(v_x, v_y, 0)$ with $\\delta u$. Then, an arbitrary vector $e$ is boosted to $e + \\delta e$, Where\n\n$$\n\\delta e = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & v_x \\\\ 0 & 0 & v_y \\\\ v_x & v_y & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ e_t \\end{bmatrix} = e_t (v_x, v_y, 0) + (e_x v_x + e_y v_y) (0, 0, 1)\n$$\n\nThis gives us the Fermi--Walker transport equation:\n\n$$\n\\delta e = - \\braket{e, u} \\delta u + \\braket{e, \\delta u}u \n$${#eq-fermi-walker}\n\n\nIf you want a more amusing mental image, here it is: Consider a spaceship that looks like a spherical ~~cow~~ porcupine in a vacuum. Every porcupine spine is a rocket engine. The spaceship can boost in any direction, but it does not rotate. Thanks to Wigner rotation, it can rotate anyway. Now, the spaceship is performing some complicated manuever in spacetime. If we let it carry around a general vector pointing in an arbitrary direction $e$, then the question is: as the vector is boosted alongside the spaceship, how does the vector change?\n\n### General Lorentz transform\n\nThe Lorentz transform in 2+1 dimensions can be derived in the same way as that of @eq-1d-lorentz. Let the rapidity vector $\\vec{w}$ be equal to $w (n_x, n_y)$, where $(n_x, n_y)$ is a unit vector (the direction of rapidity). Then the Lorentz transform is found by performing another matrix exponentiation:\n\n$$\\exp\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & n_x \\\\ 0 & 0 & n_y \\\\ n_x & n_y & 0 \\end{bmatrix} w\\right)$$\n\nTo be more succinct, we define the matrices \n\n$$K_x := \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad K_y := \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nthen the Lorentz transform is just $e^{\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{K}} = e^{w \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K}}$.\n\nNow, since $(\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K})^3 = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K}$, we have the Lorentz transform equation\n\n$$\nI + \\sinh(w) \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K} + (\\cosh(w) - 1) (\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K})^2\n$${#eq-2d-lorentz}\n\nThis equation generalizes in the obvious way to relativity in n+1 dimensions, but we will not need it.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Deriving $(\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K})^3 = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K}$\" collapse=\"true\" }\nLet $t$ stand for the index of the time-coordinate, and let $i, j, k$ be the indices of the space-coordinates. Then we have \n$$(\\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K})^3 = n_in_jn_k(e_{it} + e_{ti})(e_{jt} + e_{tj})(e_{kt} + e_{tk})$$\n\nwhere $e_{mn}$ means the matrix with entry $(m, n)$ being one and all other entries being zero. We use Einstein summation convention, so repeated indices means summing over it (except $t$, which is not an index to sum over).\n\nSince $e_{mn}e_{kl} = \\delta_{nk} e_{ml}$, and $i \\neq t, j \\neq t, k \\neq t$, the above multiplication expands to 8 terms, but only two are nonzero:\n\n$$= n_in_jn_k(e_{it}\\delta_{jk} + \\delta_{ij} e_{tk}) = \\underbrace{\\|\\vec{n}\\|^2}_{= 1} (n_i e_{it} + n_k e_{tk}) = n_i (e_{it} + e_{ti}) = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{K}$$\n:::\n\n## Wigner rotation\n\nWe are ready to derive a rarely discussed effect in special relativity: the Wigner rotation. Though it is as fundamental as time dilation and space contraction, it is not even mentioned in the undergraduate textbooks I have seen. Simply stated:\n\n::: {#thm-wigner-rotation}\n## Wigner rotation\n\nA cycle of three non-collinear boosts creates a rotation. The amount of rotation is equal to the area of the hyperbolic triangle spanned by the three vertices, and in opposite direction as the cycle.\n:::\n\nIf you make three boosts around a cycle, like $p_1 \\to p_2 \\to p_3 \\to p_1$, then you end up with a rotation. The angle of rotation is equal to the hyperbolic area of the triangle $p_1 p_2 p_3$.\n\n### Step-by-step demonstration of the Wigner rotation\n\nConsider the simplest kind of three boost cycle. We start at the rest frame, boost to the frame with 3-velocity $(v_x, 0)$, then boost to the frame with 3-velocity $(v_x, v_x d\\varphi)$, then boost back to the rest frame. It is shown in the figure below:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/wigner_rotation_3-velocity_cycle_1.png\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nIf we trace out the trajectory of every point on the space circle, we would get the following sequence:\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n![](figure/wigner_rotation_4-velocity_1.png)\n\n![](figure/wigner_rotation_4-velocity_2.png)\n\n![](figure/wigner_rotation_4-velocity_3.png)\n:::\n\nDrawn in the space of 3-velocity, it looks like:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/wigner_rotation_3-velocity_cycle_2.png\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nTherefore, after three pure boosts, we somehow ended up with a rotation by $(\\gamma - 1)d \\varphi$ radians in the opposite direction. Here, $\\gamma$ is the long semiaxis of the the boosted space circle after projecting down to the $xy$ plane. It is in fact the famed Lorentz factor \n\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}}$$\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Deriving the Lorentz factor\" collapse=\"true\" }\nThe space circle in the rest frame is spanned by $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$. After boosting by the 3-velocity $(v, 0)$, it is boosted to an ellipse with semiaxes $(\\cosh(w), 0, \\sinh(w)), (0, 1, 0)$, where $w = \\arctanh(v)$ is its rapidity. Thus, its projection to the $xy$ plane is an ellipse with semiaxes $(\\cosh(w), 0), (0, 1)$.\n\n$$\\gamma = \\cosh(w) = \\cosh(\\arctanh(v)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}}$$\n:::\n\nIf we perform boosts around a full cycle of 3-velocities, and return to our starting 3-velocity, then it is equivalent to performing an infinite number of infinitesimal triangle-circuit boosts:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/wigner_rotation_3-velocity_cycle_3.png\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nTherefore, a full cycle of boosts would rotate our space circle by a full $(\\gamma - 1)2\\pi$ radians in the opposite direction.\n\n### Interactive app for the Wigner rotation\n\nNow you are able to fully appreciate the following interactive app demonstrating the Wigner rotation. \n\nThe left picture is the $xy$ plane, and the right picture is the $xyt$ spacetime.\n\nYou can drag the black dot on the left, which stands for the 3-velocity. The 3-velocity is restricted to have maximal norm $0.8$, to keep it numerically stable. The <span style=\"color: #7887ab;\">blue</span> ellipse is the projection of the space circle to the $xy$ plane. A fixed point on the space circle is distinguished by a big <span style=\"color: red;\">red</span> dot, so that you can see how the space circle is Wigner-rotated as you drag the 3-velocity around.\n\nOn the right, the forward and backward light cones intersect at the space circle. You can drag and scroll to adjust the camera.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n    <div id=\"velocity-canvas\"></div>\n    <div id=\"spacetime-canvas\"></div>\n</div>\n<style>\n.flex-container {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center; /* Center the items horizontally */\n    align-items: center; /* Center the items vertically (if they have different heights) */\n}\n</style>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./figure/3d/3d_wigner_sketch.js\"></script>\n```\n\n\nHere is a \"tourist's guide to the visualization\".\n\nThe three boosts in animated form:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/wigner_rotation_infinitesimal_sector.gif\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nBecause $\\gamma - 1 = \\frac 23$, if you drag the 3-velocity for 3 full cycles at maximal velocity, the space circle would go -2 full cycles. \n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/wigner_rotation_3_full_cycles.gif\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\nSuppose we have a particle moving close to the speed of light, and the particle is shooting out photons at equal angular density in all directions *in its own frame*, then *in the rest frame* the photons it is shooting out are bunched in front of the particle. This is the [relativistic beaming effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_beaming), or the headlight effect.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;\">\n    <img src=\"figure/headlight_effect.gif\" alt=\"Spacetime Diagram\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n\n\n### Thomas precession {#sec-thomas-precession}\n\nEquivalently, we can present the Wigner rotation formula in the following form, often called the Thomas precession formula:\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\omega} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma + 1} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{v}\n$${#eq-thomas-precession}\n\nExperiments with particles moving in cyclotrons have verified this, thus justifying our guess that we should transport space circles without twisting.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Deriving the Thomas precession formula\" collapse=\"true\" }\nConsider a particle moving counterclockwise with constant speed $v$ in a circle of radius $R$. Its acceleration is $a = v^2/R$, and after one cycle period $T = 2\\pi R/v$, it has undergone Wigner rotation by angle $-(\\gamma - 1)2\\pi$. Simplifying, we have\n\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-(\\gamma - 1)2\\pi}{T} = \\cdots = -\\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma + 1} av$$\n\nBy the right hand rule of cross products, we can get all the directions correct with $\\vec{\\omega} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma + 1} \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{v}$.\n\nFor a general particle undergoing general acceleration, the 3-acceleration decomposes into a component parallel to the 3-velocity, and a component perpendicular to it. The parallel component does not change Wigner rotation, therefore the Thomas precession equation is still true.\n:::\n\nHowever, notice that the formula is made of 3-vectors, and we know that 3-vectors are meaningless in special relativity. This suggests that something is off here. If the rest of this section does not make much sense, come back after reading [the section on Foucault pendulum](#sec-foucault-pendulum).\n\nIf the earth were flat, then we could stand at a single point, and draw two perpendicular arrows. We say, \"This arrow is pointing $x$\", and \"This arrow is pointing $y$.\" Then we create an infinite number of missionaries. Each would pick up the two arrows, without rotating, and move the arrow to every point on earth. In this way, we would provide a unique direction for every point on earth.\n\nHowever, because the earth is a sphere, this does not work. Suppose we stand at the North Pole, and we do the same. Then all the missionaries would meet at the South Pole and start arguing about who has the right one, because they would all disagree. This problem happens because earth is curved, and transporting a vector around a cycle would rotate it.\n\nWe might shrug and say, \"Well, nobody lives in the South Pole, so we will just tell our missionaries to avoid it.\" Great idea, except then they found that Emperor of China has also sent out his own missionaries. We shrug and say, \"Well, we'll just give the Emperor of China a call and ask him what angle he picked. Then we will rotate our map until all our missionaries agreed with his.\" After some fruitless fiddling with our maps, it has dawned to us that this plan is doomed. Why?\n\nImagine if the North Pole is at point $N$, and the Emperor of China is at point $C$. If somehow, we could pick our $xy$ directions so that all our missionaries agree with his, then we can send one missionary around a three-part journey around the world: $N \\to C \\to K \\to N$, where $K$ is a point off the great circle passing $N, C$. Along the path $N \\to C$, the missionary is leaving the North Pole on a straight arc away from the North Pole, so the $xy$ chart he is carrying agrees with the missionaries he is passing by. Similarly for the other two parts. But when the missionary has returned to the North Pole, he must find his $xy$ chart rotated, contradiction!\n\nSo we sent an ICBM to take out the Emperor of China.\n\n> The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence.\n> \n> ---Hermann Weyl\n\nSimilarly, in special relativity, we can stand at the \"North Pole\" (rest frame), construct the $xyz$ axes, then send out missionaries on rockets to provide directions for every inertial frame. The good news is that no two missionaries would meet each other, so they would not argue. The bad news is that we still have the Wigner rotation problem, so if some aliens had tried the same project starting at a different, then there is absolutely no possibility for our missionaries to agree in every frame.\n\nSo, we are forced to only use one rest frame. It is in this context that the Thomas precession formula works.\n\nIf we have an object boosted from frame $p_1$ to frame $p_2$. Their 3-velocities *in the rest frame* are $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{v} + \\delta \\vec{v}$. To use the Thomas precession formula, we must first -- in imagination -- boost it back to the rest frame, and take a snapshot of its orientation against our $xyz$ axes at origin. Then we boost it back to frame $p_1$, boost it to $p_2$, and boost it -- in imagination -- back to the rest frame again. By using the Wigner rotation formula *in the rest frame*, it has rotated by\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma + 1} \\delta\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{v}\n$$\n\nTo emphasize again: the Thomas precession formula only works in one frame. It is not Lorentz invariant and not geometrically meaningful. It cannot be geometrically meaningful, because it is made of 3-vectors $\\vec{v}, \\vec{a}, \\vec{\\omega}$, and 3-vectors are geometrically meaningless in special relativity.[^3-velocity-inherently-violent]\n\n[^3-velocity-inherently-violent]: Or as I like to say, 3-vectors are inherently violent in special relativity, and anything involving anything inherently violent is also inherently violent.\n\n## Relativity in 3+1 dimensions\n\nWe began our study of special relativity in 1+1 dimensions and discovered the Lorentz transform, then proceeded to 2+1 dimensions and discovered Wigner rotation. In 3+1 dimensions, Wigner rotation still applies, but there is something new: rotations are no longer describable by a single number.\n\nThis is not a place to get into the details; suffice to say that the space of rotations in $\\R^3$ is much harder to understand than the space of rotations in $\\R^2$. We must be more careful here.\n\nSuppose we have four frames $0, 1, 2, 3$. We start with a tripod in frame $0$, then boost it successively to frames $1, 2, 3, 0$, how much does it rotate? To discover this, we need to compose the Wigner rotation around the cycle $0120$ with the Wigner rotation around the cycle $0230$. The full rotation is composed of two rotations, first rotation in the plane of the triangle $012$, and the second one in the plane of the triangle $023$.\n\nThe Wigner rotation coming from an arbitrary sequence of boosts can be calculated easily with the Thomas precession formula, if we are willing to use violence. Without violence, it is geometrically quite difficult to handle, since combining 3-dimensional rotations is much harder than adding 2-dimensional rotation angles. My intuition says that it would involve something about [principal $G$-connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle)).\n\n## Two parables\n\n### The day the earth stood still {#sec-foucault-pendulum}\n\nOne day, the earth stopped spinning. This annoyed the visitors to the science museum, who wanted to see Foucault's pendulum to rotate. To satisfy those visitors, the museum keeper put the pendulum on the top of a bus, and loaded the visitors on the bus, then they started driving around earth at the same speed as how earth used to rotate at that latitude, so that after one day, they returned to the museum. The visitors looked up at the pendulum and was satisfied to see that it indeed has turned.\n\nTo find out how much the pendulum has turned, we divide up the circular trajectory into tiny segments $p_0, p_1, ..., p_n$, then draw tiny triangles $p_0 p_1 N, p_1 p_2 N, ..., p_{n-1} p_n N$, with $N$ being the North Pole. We imagine that, instead of driving around earth in a circle, we drive around the triangle $N \\to p_0 \\to p_1 \\to N$, then the triangle $N \\to p_1 \\to p_2 \\to N$, etc.\n\nWhen we drive around $N \\to p_0 \\to p_1 \\to N$, the bus makes three turns, and each time the pendulum turns by an opposite amount relative to the bus. After three turns, the bus has turned the same angle as the sum of three external angles of the triangle. By spherical trigonometry, we know that this is equal to $2\\pi - 4\\pi\\frac{\\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\\text{surface area of earth}}$. Thus, the pendulum has turned relative to the bus by $-2\\pi + 4\\pi\\frac{\\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\\text{surface area of earth}}$. The $-2\\pi$ part is not relevant as it is just a full cycle, leaving us with just $\\frac{\\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\\text{surface area of earth}}$.\n\nTherefore, adding them up, we find that after driving around an arbitrary cycle on earth, the pendulum would have turned by\n\n$$4\\pi\\frac{\\text{area of the cycle}}{\\text{surface area of earth}}$$\n\nWe can turn this insight into a formula for Fermi--Walker transport on earth.\n\nFirst, we scale the earth so that its radius is one. Now set up the coordinate system $\\phi, \\theta$, where $\\phi$ is the latitude (zero at equator, $\\pi/2$ at the North Pole) and $\\theta$ the longitude. At each point on earth (except the two poles) we set up a local frame with two unit vectors $\\hat\\phi, \\hat\\theta$. One very important fact is that this local frame is not parallel-transported[^no-local-frame]. If you try to drive in a small circle around the North Pole, while always pointing in the direction of $\\hat\\theta$, you would feel a strong centrifugal force pushing against your steering wheel. Centrifugal forces and all other \"inertial forces\" are nature telling you that you are not being parallel-transported.\n\n[^no-local-frame]: Indeed, there is no way to cover the space with parallel-transported local frames, because the space is curved, and therefore if you try to transport a local frame in a cycle back to its starting point, it would have rotated against itself. To be a curved space is *equivalent* to have no system of parallel-transported local frame, and curvature measures the amount of rotation-against-itself that happens when you transport a local frame in an infinitesimal circle.\n\nConsider two points on earth $p_1 = (\\phi, \\theta), p_2 = (\\phi + \\delta \\phi, \\theta + \\delta\\phi)$, infinitesimally close. Since the surface area of a spherical cap around latitude $\\theta$ is $\\frac{1 -\\sin\\theta}{2}$ that of the whole sphere[^archimedes-hat-box], the area of a thin spherical triangle with vertices $p_1, p_2, N$ is \n\n$$4\\pi\\frac{1 -\\sin\\theta}{2} \\times \\frac{\\delta\\phi}{2\\pi} = (1-\\sin\\theta)\\delta\\theta$$\n\nThus, if we parallel transport a vector *clockwise* in the order $p_1 \\to N \\to p_2 \\to p_1$, then the vector would turn *counterclockwise* by $-(1 -\\sin\\theta) \\delta\\phi$.\n\n[^archimedes-hat-box]: This is immediate from [Archimedes' hat-box theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArchimedesHat-BoxTheorem.html), which is the basis of the [Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection).\n\nNow, consider two ways to move the pendulum from $p_1$ to $p_2$. We can transport it directly, or detour through the North Pole. If we detour through the North Pole like $p_1 \\to N \\to p_2$, then by the same argument as the \"polar bear puzzle\"[^polar-bear-puzzle], you see that the pendulum has rotated counterclockwise *relative to the local frame* by $-\\delta\\phi$. Then we complete its journey with $p_2 \\to p_1$, to create an *absolute*[^relative-vs-absolute-rotation] full $-(1 -\\sin\\theta) \\delta\\phi$ rotation. Therefore, moving it $p_2 \\to p_1$ have created a rotation *relative* to the local frame by $\\sin\\theta \\delta\\phi$. Since we are actually moving it $p_1 \\to p_1$, we reverse the sign, and obtain our Fermi--Walker transport equation (earthbound version):\n\n$$\n\\delta(\\text{vector angle}) = -\\sin\\theta \\delta\\phi\n$${#eq-fermi-walker-sphere}\n\n[^polar-bear-puzzle]: You walk 1 km south, 1 km east, and 1 km north, and ended up at the same point. You see a bear. Why is the bear white?\n\n[^relative-vs-absolute-rotation]: Relative rotation means that we are measuring the orientation of the vector relative to the local frame. However, since the frames themselves are not parallel-transports of each other, relative rotation is arbitrary and not a fact of geometry, but a fact of convenience. If you move the vector back to its starting point, however, there is absolutely no dispute about how much it has rotated, and it does not depend on any system of local frames. You just have to compare the vector against itself.\n\nApplied to the Foucault pendulum problem, we find that it rotates clockwise by $2\\pi \\sin\\theta$ every day, and it takes $\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}$ days to make a full rotation. At the Paris Observatory, the original place where Foucault made his experiment in 1851, we have\n\n$$\\theta = \\mathrm{48^\\circ 52' N}, \\quad \\text{period} = \\frac{\\mathrm{23h56'}}{\\sin \\theta} \\approx \\mathrm{31\\,h\\,50\\,min}$$\n\nIf a museum visitor can stay for 5 minutes at the pendulum, then they would see the pendulum complete $1/382$ of a cycle. Typical museums would put up about 400 wooden blocks in a cycle, to be knocked down by the pendulum. This allows each visitor to see at least one block being knocked down.\n\n### The star worshippers\n\nAn alien race used to worship Rigel, Deneb, and Betelgeuse, and they prayed towards the three stars. In order to pray in the correct direction even without seeing them, they constructed the Sacred Tripods, which are steel tripods that are oriented, such that each leg points at one of the Sacred Stars. These Sacred Tripods are put in public places, and required to point exactly at the Sacred Stars.\n\nThen a Cosmic Dark Age began and the stars winked out of existence, including the Sacred Stars, but the aliens did not lose their faith. Instead, they intensified their prayer in the hope of resurrecting the Sacred Stars.\n\nIn a region of space, there were two space stations A and B, at rest with each other. The Sacred Tripod on B was unstable and required yearly checking against the more stable Sacred Tripod at A. So station A would align its spare Sacred Tripod to its own one, put it on a gimbal-mount, and send it by rocket to station B. B would align its Tripod with the one sent, then let the Tripod go back.\n\nYears passed, and aliens on station B felt confident that its Tripod doesn’t drift more than $1''$ per year. One day, an asteroid field blocked the straight path, forcing the next shipment to make a big detour around the asteroid field. When it arrived, to their astonishment, it was found that the Tripod on B was clearly misaligned with the Tripod from A. What’s going on?\n\n## History notes\n\n### The history of the phenomenon\n\nThe history of the Wigner rotation is winding and complicated. Here is a brief summary.

Along with the problematic label, the geometric interpretation of velocity vectors likewise vanishes from view in Minkowski's subsequent writings. Felix Klein, for one, regretted the change; in his opinion, Minkowski later hid from view his \"innermost mathematical, especially invariant-theoretical thoughts\" on the theory of relativity (Klein 1927, 75).\n> \n>  Planck lavished praise on Einstein for his modification of the concept of time:\n> \n> > It need scarcely be emphasized that this new view of the concept of time makes the most serious demands upon the capacity of abstraction and the imaginative power of the physicist. It surpasses in boldness everything achieved so far in speculative investigations of nature, and even in philosophical theories of knowledge: nonEuclidean geometry is child’s play in comparison.30 (Planck 1910a, 117)\n> \n> Under the new space-time view, Minkowski announced, \"Three-dimensional geometry becomes a chapter of four-dimensional physics.\" In the same triumphant spirit, Minkowski suggested that his new four-dimensional understanding of the laws of physics deserved its own label. The “Principle of the Hyperbolic World” that he had tried on Hurwitz was shelved in favor of the more ecumenical \"Postulate of the Absolute World\" (Minkowski 1909, 82). Although Minkowski explained this to mean that only the four-dimensional world in space and time is given by phenomena (Minkowski 1909, 82), one suspects an inside joke with Hurwitz, since in the German mathematical community, hyperbolic geometry was sometimes referred to as [absolute geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry).\n> \n> Even the watered-down version of the space-time theory presented in Minkowski’s Cologne lecture repelled some physicists. For instance, Willy Wien’s cousin Max (1866-1938), a physicist at Danzig Polytechnic, confided to his friend Arnold Sommerfeld that reading Minkowski gave him vertigo:\n> \n> > Sommer\\[feld\\] maintains that \\[Minkowski's\\] speech in Cologne was simply grand; when reading it, however, I always get a slight brain-shiver, now (that) space and time appear conglomerated together in a gray, miserable chaos.36 (Max Wien to Arnold Sommerfeld, February 16, 1909, Benz 1975, 71)\n\n### The history of this document\n\nDuring high school, I was in the physics Olympiad team. One afternoon I got into an argument with someone about what happens if you take a square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$, boost it by $(v, 0)$, then boost it by $(0, v')$ within the boosted frame. By the [velocity addition formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Standard_configuration), the square would be moving at 3-velocity\n\n$$\n(v, \\frac{v'\\sqrt{1-v^2}}{1+vv'})\n$$\n\nIf $v' = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}-v^2}$, then the square would be moving at $(v, v)$. \n\nThen, the paradox. He thought that obviously, by the length contraction, the square should look like a diamond:\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n  <div class=\"diamond-sketch\" style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nconst diamondSketch = (elem) => {\n    return (p) => {\n        p.setup = function() {\n            p.frameRate(10);\n            p.rectMode(p.CENTER);\n            let canvas = p.createCanvas(100, 100);\n            canvas.parent(elem);\n            p.background(200);\n        };\n        p.draw = function() {\n            let step = p.frameCount % 100;\n            p.background(200);\n            let r = (2 * Math.abs(step / 100 - 0.5)) - 0.5;\n            p.applyMatrix(1, r, r, 1, 50, 50);\n            p.rect(0, 0, 50, 50);\n        };\n    }\n};\n\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.diamond-sketch').forEach((elem) => {\n    new p5(diamondSketch(elem), elem);\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n\nI objected that in the boosted frame, the square looks like a rectangle moving upwards. The rectangle is made of a bunch of line-segments all parallel to the $x'$-axis. Now, each line-segment is moving in the $y'$-direction, and $y'$ is parallel to $y$ (since the perpendicular direction is preserved under boosting), we know that each moving line-segment would still be a line-segment parallel to the $x$-axis in the resting frame. Therefore, the whole square would look like a parallelogram in the resting frame.\n\nAfter a brief shouting match, we figured out that I was right, but also that we met something no teacher has taught us before: you can create a rotation in special relativity by pure boosting.\n\nDuring my third undergraduate year, I took a course in theoretical physics, which required a term paper. I first tried to write one on the Ostrogradsky instability, but could not understand it, so I quickly switched to finally solving the rotation effect in special relativity.\n\nSuffice to say that, after some hours walking and staring at the night sky, I figured out that it is nothing else than hyperbolic geometry, and nothing more paradoxical than the fact that the external angle of a hyperbolic triangle is equal to $2\\pi + (\\text{area of the triangle})$, which I remember from hyperbolic geometry.\n\nAnd that is merely the same idea as the fact that, if you walk from the north pole to the equator, then walk $1/4$ of the way around the earth, then walk back to the north pole, then you have covered a triangle with external angle $\\frac 32 \\pi$. In general, the external angle of a triangle on the unit sphere is $2\\pi - (\\text{area of the triangle})$, the perfect opposite to hyperbolic geometry.\n\nHalf-mad, I ran home to search online and smashed all the keywords I knew must be there: \"special relativity rotation hyperbolic triangle Foucault pendulum\". My disappointment was swift and certain: This was repeatedly discovered by people all over the world in the past hundred years.\n\nBitterly I searched every undergraduate physics textbook in the school library. None included it. The standard textbook [@goldsteinClassicalMechanics2008, Section 7.3] went on a three-page long computation and found that, indeed, we get a rotation matrix:\n\n> The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two nonparallel Lorentz transformations has been declared every bit as paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of common sense, such as the so-calIed \"twin paradox\". But the present apparent paradox has important applications, especially in atomic physics, and therefore has been abundantly verified experimentally.\n\nFrom that moment on I swore that I would finally present it in a way so simple and direct that it will never be forgotten. I had found the way, and it remained to publicize to the world.\n\nThere was little use in writing another paper about it, as despite the many papers over the century, somehow this effect did not end up in the physics textbooks. I could write a blog post about it, but mere words and figures seemed insufficient. I tried promoting this idea to various physics popularizers on YouTube, but none picked it up. What I needed was interactive animation. Javascript however defeated me, and I kept it in the backlog until now. With ChatGPT I could finally write javascript tolerably for my sanity, and so, here it is.\n\n",
