  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes how the current understanding of conical refraction has been acquired after nearly two centuries of theoretical and experimental studies. A systematic use of the simplifying approximation of paraxiality is made in the chapter. This is justified by the small angles involved in conical diffraction. Conical diffraction exemplifies a fundamental feature of crystal optics----namely, the diabolical point. Belsky and Khapalyuk's exact paraxial theory of conical diffraction is explored in the chapter with an emphasis on pinhole and Gaussian beams. The chapter focuses on chiral and biaxially birefringent materials. Chirality has been found to destroy the diabolical point by separating the two sheets of the wave surface, reflecting the change of the dielectric matrix from real symmetric to complex Hermitian. The chapter demonstrates that each diabolical point splits into two branch-points, reflecting the fact that the dielectric matrix is non-Hermitian. The effects of absorption on the pattern of emerging light, as well as the combined effects of dichroism and chirality, are described.}

  abstract = {Analytical mechanics is a set of mathematical tools used to describe a wide range of physical systems, both in classical mechanics and beyond. It offers a powerful and elegant alternative to Newtonian mechanics; however it can be challenging to learn due to its high degree of mathematical complexity. Designed to offer a more intuitive guide to this abstract topic, this guide explains the mathematical theory underlying analytical mechanics; helping students to formulate, solve and interpret complex problems using these analytical tools. Each chapter begins with an example of a physical system to illustrate the theoretical steps to be developed in that chapter, and ends with a set of exercises to further develop students' understanding. The book presents the fundamentals of the subject in depth before extending the theory to more elaborate systems, and includes a further reading section to ensure that this is an accessible companion to all standard textbooks.},

THE present state of atomic theory is characterised by the fact that we not only believe the existence of atoms to be proved beyond a doubt, butalso we even believe that we have an intimate knowledge of the constituents of the individual atoms. I cannot on this occasion give a survey ofthe scientific developments that have led to this result; I will only recall the discovery of the electron towards the close of the last century, which furnished the direct verification and led to a conclusive formulation of the conception of the atomic nature of electricity which had evolved since the discovery by Faraday of the fundamental laws of electrolysis and Berzelius's electrochemical theory, and had its greatest triumph in the electrolytic dissociation theory of Arrhenius. This discovery of the electron and elucidation of its properties was the result of the work of a large number of investigators, among whom Lenard and J. J. Thomson may be particularly mentioned. The latter especially has made very important contributions to our subject by his ingenious attempts to develop ideas about atomic constitution on the basis of the electron theory. The present state of our knowledge of the elements of atomic structure was reached, however, by the discovery of the atomic nucleus, which we owe to Rutherford, whose work on the radioactive substances discovered towards the close of the last century has much enriched physical and chemical science.},

Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations.

In machine learning, the current panacea is a sigmoid network fitted using backpropagation. The pi-method, for approximating functions using noisy data, was suggested by results in mathematical approximation theory. In spite of intense activity, none of the work has had any effect on the day-to-day practice of statistics, or even on present-day theory. The useful theories was not meant to be inclusive, but even a more inclusive list would be very short. A possible reason is that it is difficult to formulate reasonable analytic models for complex data.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic analysis of the role of opponent type processing in colour vision and the relation between opponent type colour transformations and the initial three colour mechanisms. It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system.},

This implies that the distance between two colors is the length of the shortest path that connects them. We show that a Riemannian metric overestimates the perception of large color differences because large color differences are perceived as less than the sum of small differences. This effect, called diminishing returns, cannot exist in a Riemannian geometry. Consequently, we need to adapt how we model color differences, as the current standard,                                                                        {$\Delta$}                     E                                                                  , recognized by the International Commission for Weights and Measures, does not account for diminishing returns in color difference perception.                        ,              The scientific community generally agrees on the theory, introduced by Riemann and furthered by Helmholtz and Schr{\"o}dinger, that perceived color space is not Euclidean but rather, a three-dimensional Riemannian space. We show that the principle of diminishing returns applies to human color perception. This means that large color differences cannot be derived by adding a series of small steps, and therefore, perceptual color space cannot be described by a Riemannian geometry. This finding is inconsistent with the current approaches to modeling perceptual color space. Therefore, the assumed shape of color space requires a paradigm shift. Consequences of this apply to color metrics that are currently used in image and video processing, color mapping, and the paint and textile industries. These metrics are valid only for small differences. Rethinking them outside of a Riemannian setting could provide a path to extending them to large differences. This finding further hints at the existence of a second-order Weber--Fechner law describing perceived differences.},

  abstract = {The renormalization-group approach is largely responsible for the considerable success which has been achieved in the last ten years in developing a complete quantitative theory of phase transitions. Before, there was a useful physical picture of phase transitions, but a general method for making accurate quantitative predictions was lacking. Existent theories, such as the mean-field theory of Landau, sometimes reproduce phase diagrams reliably but were known to fail qualitatively near critical points, where the critical behavior is particularly interesting be\- cause of its universal character. In the mid 1960's Widom found that the singularities in thermodynamic quanti\- ties were well described by homogeneous functions. Kadanoff extended the homogeneity hypothesis to correlation functions and linked it to the idea of scale invariance. In the early 1970's Wilson showed how Kadanoff's rescaling could be explicitly carried out near the fixed point of a flow in Hamiltonian space. He made the first practical renormalization-group calculation of the flow induced by the elimination of short-wave-length Fourier components of the order-parameter field. The univer\- sality of the critical behavior emerges in a natural way in this approach, with a different fixed point for each universality class. The discovery by Wilson and Fisher of a systematic expansion procedure in E for a system in d = 4 - E dimen\- sions was followed by a cascade of calculations of critical quantities as a function of d and of the order-parameter dimensionality n.},

Yet there has been, up to now, a wide gulf between the level at which macroeconomics is taught at the undergraduate level and the level at which it is practiced. At the same time, doctoral-level textbooks are usually not targeted at a policy audience, making advanced macroeconomics less accessible to current and aspiring practitioners. This book, born out of the Masters course the authors taught for many years at the Harvard Kennedy School, fills this gap. It introduces the tools of dynamic optimization in the context of economic growth, and then applies them to a wide range of policy questions - ranging from pensions, consumption, investment and finance, to the most recent developments in fiscal and monetary policy. It does so with the requisite rigor, but also with a light touch, and an unyielding focus on their application to policy-making, as befits the authors' own practical experience. Advanced Macroeconomics: An Easy Guide is bound to become a great resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and practitioners alike.},

  abstract = {Most of us get inspired by and interact with the world around us based on visual cues such as the colors and patterns that we see. In nature, coloration takes three primary forms: pigmentary coloration, structural coloration, and bioluminescence. Typically, pigmentary and structural coloration are used by animals and plants for their survival; however, few organisms are able to capture the nearly instantaneous and visually astounding display that cephalopods (e.g., octopi, squid, and cuttlefish) exhibit. Notably, the structural coloration of these cephalopods critically relies on a unique family of proteins known as reflectins. As a result, there is growing interest in characterizing the structure and function of such optically-active proteins (e.g., reflectins) and to leverage these materials across a broad range of disciplines, including bioengineering. In this review, I begin by briefly introducing pigmentary and structural coloration in animals and plants as well as highlighting the extraordinary appearance-changing capabilities of cephalopods. Next, I outline recent advances in the characterization and utilization of reflectins for photonic technologies and and discuss general strategies and limitations for the structural and optical characterization of proteins. Finally, I explore future directions of study for optically-active proteins and their potential applications. Altogether, this review aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers who can resolve the fundamental questions regarding the structure, function, and self-assembly of optically-active protein-based materials.},

I will contrast their characters and scientific styles as manifested in their social and scientific activity influenced by the cultural traditions of their countries and the social and scientific milieu of their time. Also, in these sections, I will discuss features of their familial relationships that affected their youth, their psychology, and the shaping of their characters. I will compare their writing styles emphasizing the differences observed between Gibbs's dense and austere style, unlike Duhem's detailed and informative way of writing his essays. I will further examine the way by which each physicist used Mach's doctrine of the economy of thought in shaping their writing style. A final contrast is reserved for their pedagogical styles. In this case, I will let their students and colleagues speak for them, while I comment on why they did not leave behind a school of thought.},

An observer bound to the portion of matter will associate with it a frequency determined by its internal energy, namely, by its ``mass at rest.'' An observer for whom a portion of matter is in steady motion with velocity c, will see this frequency lower in consequence of the Lorentz-Einstein time transformation. I have been able to show (Comptes rendus, September 10 and 24, of the Paris Academy of Sciences) that the fixed observer will constantly see the internal periodical phenomenon in phase with a wave the frequency of which is determined by the quantum relation using the whole energy of the moving body---provided it is assumed that the wave spreads with the velocity c/. This wave, the velocity of which is greater than c, cannot carry energy.},

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4\% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4\% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5\%) or FLAC (30.3\%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.},

The parametric invariance was used by Ehrenfest as a principle related to the quantization rules of the old quantum mechanics. It was also considered by Rayleigh in the determination of pressure caused by vibration, and the general approach we follow here is based on his. Specific calculation of invariants in classical and quantum mechanics are determined. The Hertz invariant, which is a volume in phase space, is extended to the case of a variable number of particles. We show that the slow parametric change leads to the adiabatic process, allowing the definition of entropy as a parametric invariance.},

  abstract = {The subject of this book is threshold elements, and the problem consists of several questions aimed at the logical capabilities of a single threshold element and at the synthesis or design of combinational digital systems (e.g., computers) using these devices. A threshold element is primarily a logical gate or a basic building block, and it is one of the most powerful gates known to us today. The work is important on three counts: It is the first book on the subject of threshold elements; it presents an approach not often encountered in the design of digital systems; and it contains primarily original results which answer the basic problem in a number of ways. These results which include a number of synthesis procedures are presented in detail and are illustrated with examples. In the interest of continuity, some results of other investigators are briefly, though fully, explained. THRESHOLD LOGIC: A Synthesis Approach shows how a basic approach (correlation) can be used in treating the questions of threshold element synthesis. A number of scattered concepts are unified through this approach under one idea (the characteristic-vector language). This monograph should interest students and engineers as well as researchers in the fields of threshold logic, logic design, and switching theory in general, as well as in bionics and in computer design.},

This leads to the idea of decomposing space-time into two families of space-like hypersurfaces. Such a decomposition suggests that the freely specifiable initial data or gravitational degrees of freedom of the theory may be cast into the so-called conformal 2-structure. The formalism for describing this decomposition, called the co-variant orthogonal \{2+2\{ formalism, is outlined in some detail. Subsequently the refinement which enables particular holonomic and anholonomic i.v.p's to be handled is introduced and illustrated by a particular i.v.p. (the anholonomic double null i.v.p.). A short discussion of computer implementation of formalisms is followed by some general remarks about the field of Numerical Relativity.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {A ``frame of reference'' is a standard relative to whichmotion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that areat rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describethe relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore apurely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motionwithout regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical accountof motion leads to the idea of an ``inertial frame,'' or areference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamicalproperties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood asa spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time,so that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions.The laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: aninertial frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative towhich the motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinearand uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in thedirection of applied forces, and applied forces are always met withequal and opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame,the center of mass of a closed system of interacting bodies is alwaysat rest or in uniform motion. It also follows that any other frame ofreference moving uniformly relative to an inertial frame is also aninertial frame. For example, in Newtonian celestial mechanics, takingthe ``fixed stars'' as a frame of reference, we can, inprinciple, determine an (approximately) inertial frame whose center isthe center of mass of the solar system; relative to this frame, everyacceleration of every planet can be accounted for (approximately) as agravitational interaction with some other planet in accord withNewton's laws of motion.},

A convention in these discussions is to treat the light environment as binary---night is dark, day is light---and to impute corresponding selective pressure on the visual systems and behaviors of primates. In consequence, debate has tended to focus on whether a given trait can be interpreted as evidence of nocturnal or diurnal behavior in the primate fossil record. Such classification elides the variability in light, or the ways that primates internalize light in their environments. Here, we explore the liminality of light by focusing on what it is, its many sources, and its flux under natural conditions. We conclude by focusing on the intensity and spectral properties of twilight, and we review the mounting evidence of its importance as a cue that determines the onset or offset of primate activities as well as the entrainment of circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {"This unique book presents a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity. The author encourages students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure. The unification of space and time introduced by Einstein's special theory of relativity is one of the cornerstones of the modern scientific description of the universe. Yet the unification is counterintuitive because we perceive time very differently from space. Even in relativity, time is not just another dimension, it is one with different properties The book treats the geometry of hyperbolas as the key to understanding special relativity. The author simplifies the formulas and emphasizes their geometric content. Many important relations, including the famous relativistic addition formula for velocities, then follow directly from the appropriate (hyperbolic) trigonometric addition formulas. Prior mastery of (ordinary) trigonometry is sufficient for most of the material presented, although occasional use is made of elementary differential calculus, and the chapter on electromagnetism assumes some more advanced knowledge. Changes to the Second Edition The treatment of Minkowski space and spacetime diagrams has been expanded. Several new topics have been added, including a geometric derivation of Lorentz transformations, a discussion of three-dimensional spacetime diagrams, and a brief geometric description of "area" and how it can be used to measure time and distance. Minor notational changes were made to avoid conflict with existing usage in the literature"--},

It traces how the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld gave way to the matrix mechanics of Heisenberg and others and to the wave mechanics of Schr{\"o}dinger. It then turns to the emergence of statistical transformation theory and the Hilbert space formalism unifying these two forms of the new quantum theory. It uses the metaphor of an arch built on a scaffold to capture these developments. The volume provides detailed analyses of the classic papers of Heisenberg, Born, Jordan, Pauli, Dirac, De Broglie, Einstein, Schr{\"o}dinger, von Neumann and others laying the foundations of modern quantum mechanics. Drawing on correspondence and later reminiscences of these authors and synthesizing much of the extensive secondary literature on the breakthrough to modern quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s, this volume presents an authoritative new account of the genesis of quantum mechanics.

  abstract = {Although the use of statistics in legal proceedings has considerably grown in the last 40 years, primarily classical statistical methods rather than Bayesian methods have been used. Yet the Bayesian approach avoids many of the problems of classical statistics and is also well suited to a broader range of problems. This article reviews the potential and actual use of Bayes in the law and explains the main reasons for its lack of impact on legal practice. These reasons include misconceptions by the legal community about Bayes' theorem, overreliance on the use of the likelihood ratio, and the lack of adoption of modern computational methods. We argue that Bayesian networks, which automatically produce the necessary Bayesian calculations, provide an opportunity to address most concerns about using Bayes in the law.},

We discuss the estimation of entropy rate from empirical data, and review both parametric and non-parametric techniques. We look at many different assumptions on properties of the processes for parametric processes, in particular focussing on Markov and Gaussian assumptions. Non-parametric estimation relies on limit theorems which involve the entropy rate from observations, and to discuss these, we introduce some theory and the practical implementations of estimators of this type.},

Every model of ZFC is the mantle and generic mantle of another model of ZFC. We prove this theorem while also controlling the HOD of the final model, as well as the generic HOD. Iteratively taking the mantle penetrates down through the inner mantles to what we call the outer core, what remains when all outer layers of forcing have been stripped away.

Numerous success stories have rapidly spread all over science, industry and society, but its limitations have only recently come into focus. In this Perspective we seek to distil how many of deep learning's failures can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in comparative psychology, education and linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications.},

This approach is providing new insights, particularly into few-particle complex systems, such as gene circuits, protein conformational reaction coordinates, network traffic, bird flocking, cell motility, and neuronal firing.},

This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, ``Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?'' Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text.},

When applied to written English, NSRPS gives entropy estimates which are very close to those obtained by other methods. Using ca. 135 GB of input data from the project Gutenberg, we estimate the effective entropy to be \${\textbackslash}approx 1.82\$ bit/character. Extrapolating to infinitely long input, the true value of the entropy is estimated as \${\textbackslash}approx 0.8\$ bit/character.},

The book begins by applying Lagrange's equations to a number of mechanical systems. It introduces the concepts of generalized coordinates and generalized momentum. Following this the book turns to the calculus of variations to derive the Euler--Lagrange equations. It introduces Hamilton's principle and uses this throughout the book to derive further results. The Hamiltonian, Hamilton's equations, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets and Hamilton--Jacobi theory are considered next. The book concludes by discussing continuous Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and how they are related to field theory. Written in clear, simple language and featuring numerous worked examples and exercises to help students master the material, this book is a valuable supplement to courses in mechanics.},

In vision, sense dataare typically described as patches exhibiting colors and shapes. Forthe other senses, they would manifest sounds, tastes, odors, andtactile qualities. Suppose that you are looking at a brown table witha white coaster on it; your sense data would be a patch of browncorresponding to the brown expanse in your field of view, along with aroundish-shaped white patch. Based on such data, you might come toaffirm that a brown thing and a white thing, or a table and a coaster,are present before you.},

Max Cal, a variant of maximum entropy, predicts dynamical distribution functions by maximizing a path entropy subject to dynamical constraints, such as average fluxes. We first show that Max Cal leads to standard near-equilibrium results---including the Green-Kubo relations, Onsager's reciprocal relations of coupled flows, and Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production---in a way that is particularly simple. We develop some generalizations of the Onsager and Prigogine results that apply arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Because Max Cal does not require any notion of ``local equilibrium,'' or any notion of entropy dissipation, or temperature, or even any restriction to material physics, it is more general than many traditional approaches. It also applicable to flows and traffic on networks, for example.},

  abstract = {We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7\% improvement over Gopher.},

Individuals who become interested in color vision in animals come from a variety of different educational backgrounds{\texthorizontalbar}from the traditional biological and behavioral sciences as well as from more applied fields. Accordingly, this book includes sufficient tutorial information about color vision so that a relative newcomer would be able to make sense out of this area without having to search out still more background material. To provide this, basic information about the psychophysics of color vision and about the methods used to study color vision in animals is presented; along with coverage of the broad range of biological mechanisms responsible for color vision. Subsequent chapters present systematic reviews of studies of color vision in a wide selection of vertebrate species. The final chapter is devoted to a discussion of two fascinating issues raised by studies of animal color vision: the evolutionary origins and the functional utility of color vision.},

Over the course of a month, the game was played by over 1.5 million users who engaged in anonymous two-minute chat sessions with either another human or an AI language model which was prompted to behave like humans. The task of the players was to correctly guess whether they spoke to a person or to an AI. This largest scale Turing-style test conducted to date revealed some interesting facts. For example, overall users guessed the identity of their partners correctly in only 68\% of the games. In the subset of the games in which users faced an AI bot, users had even lower correct guess rates of 60\% (that is, not much higher than chance). This white paper details the development, deployment, and results of this unique experiment. While this experiment calls for many extensions and refinements, these findings already begin to shed light on the inevitable near future which will commingle humans and AI.},

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them.},

The book features end-of-chapter practice problems, an appendix of worked problems, a glossary of terms, and an annotated bibliography. Accomplished teacher Don S. Lemons uses thermodynamics to solve problems from a broad range of physics. He illustrates not only the fundamentals of the subject but also advanced topics such as the relationship between the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. He highlights the intellectual structure and history of the discipline and explores the logical consequences of each of the famous three laws. Lemons explains and develops the first two laws and their corollaries, the methods and applications of thermodynamics, and the third law, as well as non-fluid variables, equilibrium and stability, and two-phase systems.},

The concept of adiabatic invariance to all orders is formulated precisely in Section I. In Section II, a classical one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator is treated. It is proved that the action integral extended over a period of the instantaneous time independent problem is an adiabatic invariant to all orders. Section III is devoted to the extension of the Born-Fock quantum mechanical adiabatic theorem to all orders. The systems to which the proof applies in all rigor are those which have a finite number of nondegenerate quantum states which do not cross in the process of adiabatic change. The proofs are based on a systematic construction of the asymptotic expansion in the slowness parameter of the statistical distribution function which describes an initially stationary ensemble of systems.}

  abstract = {This 25th anniversary edition of Steven Levy's classic book traces the exploits of the computer revolution's original hackers -- those brilliant and eccentric nerds from the late 1950s through the early '80s who took risks, bent the rules, and pushed the world in a radical new direction. With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zukerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.  Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as "the hacker ethic," that still thrives today. Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.   Amazon.com Exclusive: The Rant Heard Round the World  By Steven Levy   Author Steven Levy When I began researching Hackers--so many years ago that it's scary--I thought I'd largely be chronicling the foibles of a sociologically weird cohort who escaped normal human interaction by retreating to the sterile confines of computers labs. Instead, I discovered a fascinating, funny cohort who wound up transforming human interaction, spreading a culture that affects our views about everything from politics to entertainment to business. The stories of those amazing people and what they did is the backbone of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.   But when I revisited the book recently to prepare the 25th Anniversary Edition of my first book, it was clear that I had luckily stumbled on the origin of a computer (and Internet) related controversy that still permeates the digital discussion. Throughout the book I write about something I called The Hacker Ethic, my interpretation of several principles implicitly shared by true hackers, no matter whether they were among the early pioneers from MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club (the Mesopotamia of hacker culture), the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club (who invented the PC industry), or the slick kid programmers of commercial game software. One of those principles was ``Information Should Be Free.'' This wasn't a justification of stealing, but an expression of the yearning to know more so one could hack more. The programs that early MIT hackers wrote for big computers were stored on paper tapes. The hackers would keep the tapes in a drawer by the computer so anyone could run the program, change it, and then cut a new tape for the next person to improve. The idea of ownership was alien.  This idea came under stress with the advent of personal computers. The Homebrew Club was made of fanatic engineers, along with a few social activists who were thrilled at the democratic possibilities of PCs. The first home computer they could get their hands on was 1975's Altair, which came in a kit that required a fairly hairy assembly process. (Its inventor was Ed Roberts, an underappreciated pioneer who died earlier this year.) No software came with it. So it was a big deal when 19-year-old Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen wrote a BASIC computer language for it. The Homebrew people were delighted with Altair BASIC, but unhappy that Gates and Allen charged real money for it. Some Homebrew people felt that their need for it outweighed their ability to pay. And after one of them got hold of a ``borrowed'' tape with the program, he showed up at a meeting with a box of copies (because it is so easy to make perfect copies in the digital age), and proceeded to distribute them to anyone who wanted one, gratis.  This didn't sit well with Bill Gates, who wrote what was to become a famous ``Letter to Hobbyists,'' basically accusing them of stealing his property. It was the computer-age equivalent to Luther posting the Ninety-Five Theses on the Castle Church. Gate's complaints would reverberate well into the Internet age, and variations on the controversy persist. Years later, when another undergrad named Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that kicked off massive piracy of song files over the Internet, we saw a bloodier replay of the flap. Today, issues of cost, copying and control still rage--note Viacom's continuing lawsuit against YouTube and Google. And in my own business---journalism--availability of free news is threatening more traditional, expensive new-gathering. Related issues that also spring from controversies in Hackers are debates over the ``walled gardens'' of Facebook and Apple's iPad.  I ended the original Hackers with a portrait of Richard Stallman, an MIT hacker dedicated to the principle of free software. I recently revisited him while gathering new material for the 25th Anniversary Edition of Hackers, he was more hard core than ever. He even eschewed the Open Source movement for being insufficiently noncommercial.  When I spoke to Gates for the update, I asked him about his 1976 letter and the subsequent intellectual property wars. ``Don't call it war,'' he said. ``Thank God we have an incentive system. Striking the right balance of how this should work, you know, there's going to be tons of exploration.'' Then he applied the controversy to my own situation as a journalism. ``Things are in a crazy way for music and movies and books,'' he said. ``Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now. Who knows? Maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night.''  So Amazon.com readers, it's up to you. Those who have not read Hackers,, have fun and be amazed at the tales of those who changed the world and had a hell of time doing it. Those who have previously read and loved Hackers, replace your beat-up copies, or the ones you loaned out and never got back, with this beautiful 25th Anniversary Edition from O'Reilly with new material about my subsequent visits with Gates, Stallman, and younger hacker figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. If you don't I may have to buy a scissors--and the next bad haircut could be yours! Read Bill Gates' letter to hobbyists},

For the most interesting extreme, when the system volume is large, while the piston is moving with great speed (compared to thermal velocity) for a very short time, the necessary number of independent experimental runs to obtain a reasonable approximation for the free energy from averaging the nonequilibrium work grows exponentially with the system size.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

The phenomenal self, however, is not a thing but an ongoing process; it is the content of a "transparent self-model." In Being No One, Metzinger, a German philosopher, draws strongly on neuroscientific research to present a representationalist and functional analysis of what a consciously experienced first-person perspective actually is. Building a bridge between the humanities and the empirical sciences of the mind, he develops new conceptual toolkits and metaphors; uses case studies of unusual states of mind such as agnosia, neglect, blindsight, and hallucinations; and offers new sets of multilevel constraints for the concept of consciousness. Metzinger's central question is: How exactly does strong, consciously experienced subjectivity emerge out of objective events in the natural world? His epistemic goal is to determine whether conscious experience, in particular the experience of being someone that results from the emergence of a phenomenal self, can be analysed on subpersonal levels of description. He also asks if and how our Cartesian intuitions that subjective experiences as such can never be reductively explained are themselves ultimately rooted in the deeper representational structure of our conscious minds},

Since the 1950s, his work involved trying to uncover human thinking processes and replicate them in machines. [Listener: Christopher Sykes]; date recorded: 2011] TRANSCRIPT: So then in my senior year{\dots} I was{\dots} I was majoring in physics mostly and with fairly poor grades because I was doing so many other things{\dots} and I thought I would make up for this by doing a good thesis, but it turned out at Harvard, physics students can't{\dots} they don't have an undergraduate thesis, but they do in math. So, I asked Andy Gleason why can't I just switch to math and do a thesis and he said: 'No problem,' signed something and I decided to do a thesis on fixed point theorems which was a beautiful little fragment of mathematics that{\dots} that I was very interested in. And there was a theorem that{\dots} Kakutani was a professor at Yale and here's an example of a fixed point theorem: Of{\dots} consider that at each point in the world on{\dots} on the earth, there's a temperature and there's a humidity, and these vary continuously over{\dots} over continuous functions. So there's two continuous functions on this sphere. Kakutani{\dots} somebody else had proved that{\dots} I forget who{\dots} Whitney, Professor Whitney, was a friend of mine at Harvard actually, had proved that you can find two points on the earth which are exactly opposite points which have the same temperature and the same humidity. This is rather surprising. So that{\dots} that was a famous fixed point theorem. Or you could say there's, if you consider mountains{\dots}  There's two points which have the same altitude and the same temperature, any two functions. It's very strange, why should that be? Anyway, Kakutani had proved that if you take a{\dots} you can find a triangle, an equilateral triangle, that is{\dots} 60¬∫ angles, the same thing is true, for an equilateral triangle you can find three points which will have the same temperature and pressure{\dots} or temperature and humidity. So that was Kakutani's fixed point theorem. He was a professor at Yale -- I'd never met him actually -- so that's very interesting because it shows that somehow if you have an extra point you can{\dots} you can do a little more because now they're equal at three points.  Isn't that funny? And so then I said: 'Well, what about other... why does it have to be an equilateral triangle?' And so I worked on that a lot and I managed to prove that if it were a right triangle, it was also true and also if it were a triangle which were three points of a regular pentagon, that would be{\dots} the same thing would be true. And that's as far as I got, I couldn't prove it for any old triangle. But, anyway, my proof of the thing for the pentagon impressed Gleason and that was probably why he told Princeton they had to admit me as a graduate student. That's the next step for a mathematician. So it was a great adventure and{\dots} but it always haunted me that I couldn't show this thing for any old triangle.},

One approach to understanding emergence is to find continuous {\textbackslash}textit\{progress measures\} that underlie the seemingly discontinuous qualitative changes. We argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components. As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered phenomenon of ``grokking'' exhibited by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us to study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Our results show that grokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.},

  abstract = {One of the most important{\texthorizontalbar}and beautiful{\texthorizontalbar}mathematical solutions ever devised, Noether's theorem touches on every aspect of physics."In the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Fr{\"a}ulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began."{\texthorizontalbar}Albert EinsteinThe year was 1915, and the young mathematician Emmy Noether had just settled into G{\"o}ttingen University when Albert Einstein visited to lecture on his nearly finished general theory of relativity. Two leading mathematicians of the day, David Hilbert and Felix Klein, dug into the new theory with gusto, but had difficulty reconciling it with what was known about the conservation of energy. Knowing of her expertise in invariance theory, they requested Noether's help. To solve the problem, she developed a novel theorem, applicable across all of physics, which relates conservation laws to continuous symmetries{\texthorizontalbar}one of the most important pieces of mathematical reasoning ever developed.Noether's ``first'' and ``second'' theorem was published in 1918. The first theorem relates symmetries under global spacetime transformations to the conservation of energy and momentum, and symmetry under global gauge transformations to charge conservation. In continuum mechanics and field theories, these conservation laws are expressed as equations of continuity. The second theorem, an extension of the first, allows transformations with local gauge invariance, and the equations of continuity acquire the covariant derivative characteristic of coupled matter-field systems. General relativity, it turns out, exhibits local gauge invariance. Noether's theorem also laid the foundation for later generations to apply local gauge invariance to theories of elementary particle interactions. In Dwight E. Neuenschwander's new edition of Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem, readers will encounter an updated explanation of Noether's ``first'' theorem. The discussion of local gauge invariance has been expanded into a detailed presentation of the motivation, proof, and applications of the ``second'' theorem, including Noether's resolution of concerns about general relativity. Other refinements in the new edition include an enlarged biography of Emmy Noether's life and work, parallels drawn between the present approach and Noether's original 1918 paper, and a summary of the logic behind Noether's theorem.},

In his work Schr{\"o}dinger proposed a projective geometry of color space, rather than a Euclidean line-element. He also proposed new (at the time) colorimetric methods - in detail and at length - which represented a dramatic conceptual shift in colorimetry. Schr{\"o}dinger shows how the trichromatic (or Young-Helmholtz) theory of color and the opponent-process (or Hering) theory of color are formally the same theory, or at least only trivially different. These translations of Schr{\"o}dinger's bold concepts for color space have a fresh resonance and importance for contemporary color theory},

  abstract = {It has been argued that science is generated and validated through processes of controversy, and that controversies are 'closed' through 'rhetorical' processes of 'enrolment of heterogeneous allies and resources.' It has also been argued that, once a controversy is closed, it is increasingly difficult for the 'losing' position to maintain the plausibility of its views, arguments, and interpretations (words like 'reification,' 'inertia,' and 'institutionalisation' have been used to refer to this). Controversies have shaped neural network research throughout its history, from the 1950s to the 1980s. In this dissertation I analyse the history of neural network research using a 'controversy/rhetorical tactics/enrolment of allies and resources/closure' scheme. I claim that the result is a useful and powerful interpretation of the main developments of the evolution of neural network research. The neural network controversy is especially interesting because it was once (in the late 1960s) closed against neural networks, and twenty years later (in the late 1980s) it was reopened. The history of neural network research can be seen as the history of the closure and reopening of the neural network controversy.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the scientific controversies that have shaped neural network research from a sociological point of view. It looks at the controversy that surrounded Frank Rosenblatt's perceptron machine in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Rosenblatt was well aware of the main problems of his machine, and that he even insisted on them in his books and papers. Emphasis is given on one of the main problems of early neural network research, namely the issue of training multilayer systems. In the middle of the perceptron controversy, Minsky and Papert embarked on a project aimed at showing the limitations of Rosenblatt's perceptron beyond doubt. The chapter analyzes the main results of that project, and shows that Minsky and Papert, and neural network researchers interpreted those results rather differently. It discusses the processes through which this interpretative flexibility was closed and the effects that the crisis of early neural network research had upon the three most important neural network groups of the time, namely Widrow's group, Rosenblatt's group, and the group at SRI. The chapter also looks at the influence that factors like the emergence of symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) and computer technology had on the closure of the neural network controversy. After the closure of the perceptron controversy, symbol-processing remained the dominant approach to AI over the years, until the early 1980s. Some of the most important aspects of that changing context are reviewed and the history of back-propagation is discussed.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to AI had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic AI approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the 'research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate.},

  abstract = {The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume {$<$}1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary {\textasciitilde}5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be {\textasciitilde}1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be {\textasciitilde}2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to {\textasciitilde}100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.},

In this setting, questions about data efficiency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through a process of "grokking" a pattern in the data, improving generalization performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.},

The basic concepts and ideas, as well as their mathematical background, are provided, putting Riemann's reasoning into the more general and systematic perspective achieved by later mathematicians and physicists (including Helmholtz, Ricci, Weyl, and Einstein) on the basis of his seminal ideas. Following a historical introduction that positions Riemann's work in the context of his times, the history of the concept of space in philosophy, physics and mathematics is systematically presented. A subsequent chapter on the reception and influence of the text accompanies the reader from Riemann's times to contemporary research. Not only mathematicians and historians of the mathematical sciences, but also readers from other disciplines or those with an interest in physics or philosophy will find this work both appealing and insightful},

Whoever is right, it is assumed that our technological successor will be an upgraded or degraded version of us: Human 2.0. Posthuman Life argues that the enhancement debate projects a human face onto an empty screen. We do not know what will happen and, not being posthuman, cannot anticipate how posthumans will assess the world. If a posthuman future will not necessarily be informed by our kind of subjectivity or morality the limits of our current knowledge must inform any ethical or political assessment of that future. Posthuman Life develops a critical metaphysics of posthuman succession and argues that only a truly speculative posthumanism can support an ethics that meets the challenge of the transformative potential of technology.},

  abstract = {Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future.The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book.Contributors : James A.

From antiquity into theeighteenth century, contrary views which denied that space and timeare real entities maintained that the world is necessarily a materialplenum. Concerning space, they held that the idea of empty space is aconceptual impossibility. Space is nothing but an abstraction we useto compare different arrangements of the bodies constituting theplenum. Concerning time, they insisted, there can be no lapse of timewithout change occurring somewhere. Time is merely a measure of cycles of change within the world.},

  abstract = {I apply recent work on "learning to think" (2015) and on PowerPlay (2011) to the incremental training of an increasingly general problem solver, continually learning to solve new tasks without forgetting previous skills. The problem solver is a single recurrent neural network (or similar general purpose computer) called ONE. ONE is unusual in the sense that it is trained in various ways, e.g., by black box optimization / reinforcement learning / artificial evolution as well as supervised / unsupervised learning. For example, ONE may learn through neuroevolution to control a robot through environment-changing actions, and learn through unsupervised gradient descent to predict future inputs and vector-valued reward signals as suggested in 1990. User-given tasks can be defined through extra goal-defining input patterns, also proposed in 1990. Suppose ONE has already learned many skills. Now a copy of ONE can be re-trained to learn a new skill, e.g., through neuroevolution without a teacher. Here it may profit from re-using previously learned subroutines, but it may also forget previous skills. Then ONE is retrained in PowerPlay style (2011) on stored input/output traces of (a) ONE's copy executing the new skill and (b) previous instances of ONE whose skills are still considered worth memorizing. Simultaneously, ONE is retrained on old traces (even those of unsuccessful trials) to become a better predictor, without additional expensive interaction with the enviroment. More and more control and prediction skills are thus collapsed into ONE, like in the chunker-automatizer system of the neural history compressor (1991). This forces ONE to relate partially analogous skills (with shared algorithmic information) to each other, creating common subroutines in form of shared subnetworks of ONE, to greatly speed up subsequent learning of additional, novel but algorithmically related skills.},

Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy.Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.},

  abstract = {Crackling noise arises when a system responds to changing external conditions through discrete, impulsive events spanning a broad range of sizes. A wide variety of physical systems exhibiting crackling noise have been studied, from earthquakes on faults to paper crumpling. Because these systems exhibit regular behaviour over a huge range of sizes, their behaviour is likely to be independent of microscopic and macroscopic details, and progress can be made by the use of simple models. The fact that these models and real systems can share the same behaviour on many scales is called universality. We illustrate these ideas by using results for our model of crackling noise in magnets, explaining the use of the renormalization group and scaling collapses, and we highlight some continuing challenges in this still-evolving field.},

  abstract = {The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {A long history of analogy making between neoclassical economics and physical thermodynamics has unfortunately served to obscure two important relations between the two fields: their definitions of equilibria stem from essentially the same three axioms for the mathematical representations of systems, while the classes of transformation each has chosen to emphasize, and their responses to the problem of path dependence, have led them to very different interpretations of duality in those representations. Despite these conventional differences, we show that economies in which all agents have preferences quasi-linear in some good have a trading-constraint structure isomorphic to the structure of physical systems with classical thermodynamic equations of state. Exact equivalents of thermodynamic potentials, including entropy, can be constructed, and function as the economic counterparts to free energies. Quasi-linear economies are the most general in which the Walrasian idea of price formation as an analog of force balance can be realized. More general economic models raise the same methodological problems as more complex physical models that exhibit path-dependence. We show how the degree of aggregatability of an economic model corresponds to which properties of equilibria retain path-independence, and to the extent to which a social-welfare function exists. A new contour money-metric utility defines the maximal generalization of social-welfare functions in arbitrary economies, but depends on the endowments and composition of the economy in non-quasi-linear cases, and is limited to one-dimensional contours of equilibria in non-aggregatable cases. The differences between economic and thermodynamic methodology lies in the economic focus on the irreversible movement from initial disequilibrium endowments to equilibrium through voluntary trade, in contrast to the thermodynamic recognition that only reversible transformations lead to measurement of system structure. The consequences of respecting reversibility for economic method are sketched, and alternative interpretations of the Walrasian notion of wealth preservation are presented.},

This Arrow-Debreu model (known for two of its most prominent founders, both Nobel Laureates) is the basis of modern price theory and of a wide range of applications. The text starts with elementary models: Robinson Crusoe, the Edgeworth Box, and a 2-commodity 2-household 2-firm model. It gives a brief introduction to the mathematics used in the field (continuity, convexity, separation theorems, Brouwer fixed-point theorem, point-to-set mappings, and Shapley-Folkman theorem). It then presents the mathematical general equilibrium model in progressively more general settings, including point-valued, set-valued, and nonconvex set-valued demand and supply. Existence of general equilibrium, fundamental theorems of welfare economics, core convergence, and futures markets with time and uncertainty are treated fully. The new edition updates discussion throughout and expands the number and variety of exercises. It offers a revised and extended treatment of core convergence, including the case of non-convex preferences, and introduces the investigation of approximate equilibrium with U-shaped curves and non-convex preferences.},

For self-dual spin or gauge systems this transformation is shown to be differentiably conjugate to another one, which is obtained as a high-temperature approximation. The conjugation relation is established through the duality mapping. This explains the mechanism leading to some exact results obtained with Migdal's differential renormalization equation. The last equation is also explicitly rederived as the result of potential-moving approximations inspired by the methods of differential renormalization in real space. Some applications and extensions of the above results are finally considered in connection with an approach, which was recently proposed for systematically improving Migdal's approximation.}

Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs---30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers---a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

It is generally interpreted that these changes are due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores. Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores. In addition, we show that a deeper population of iridophores with larger crystals reflects a substantial proportion of sunlight especially in the near-infrared range. The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection.},

Evolution through artificial selection has been practiced by humans for a large part of our history, in the breeding of plants and livestock. Artificial evolution, where we evolve an artifact through artificial selection, has been around since electronic computers became common: about 30 years. Right from the beginning, people have suggested using artificial evolution to design electronics automatically.l Only recently, though, have suitable re\- configurable silicon chips become available that make it easy for artificial evolution to work with a real, physical, electronic medium: before them, ex\- periments had to be done entirely in software simulations. Early research concentrated on the potential applications opened-up by the raw speed ad\- vantage of dedicated digital hardware over software simulation on a general\- purpose computer. This book is an attempt to show that there is more to it than that. In fact, a radically new viewpoint is possible, with fascinating consequences. This book was written as a doctoral thesis, submitted in September 1996. As such, it was a rather daring exercise in ruthless brevity. Believing that the contribution I had to make was essentially a simple one, I resisted being drawn into peripheral discussions. In the places where I deliberately drop a subject, this implies neither that it's not interesting, nor that it's not relevant: just that it's not a crucial part of the tale I want to tell here.},

To get from one theory to the other, we know that Einstein relied on a certain number of fundamental concepts, such as the equivalence principle, and a few key mathematical techniques, for instance, the absolute tensor calculus of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi Civita. Einstein also had need of a third theory and technique, elaborated by his former mathematics professor, Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), although he did not recognize this for several years. In this paper, we examine the fortunes of Minkowski ` s space-time theory from 1908 to 1916. Our focus is on the emergence of Minkowski `s four-dimensional formalism as a standard technique in theoretical physics, and we investigate one aspect of this history in some detail: the reformulation and reinterpretation of the laws of special relativity in the language of non-Euclidean geometry. The related work done on the space-time theory, or what we call the `non-Euclidean style ` of Minkowskian relativity, provides an example of the geometrization of physics brought about by Minkowski and his followers.},

SOC, and more generally fractals and power laws, have attracted much comment, ranging from the very positive to the polemical. The other papers (Aschwanden et~al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue; McAteer et~al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2015, this issue; Sharma et~al. in Space Sci. Rev. 2015, in preparation) in this special issue showcase the considerable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma inspired by the SOC~idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has played in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma instabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a scientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant that SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from the definition originally given by its creators. In Bak's own field of theoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open questions, even 25 years on (Pruessner 2012). One aim of the present review is to address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some areas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it triggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of SOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed matter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original papers.},

  abstract = {We consider one-dimensional classical time-dependent Hamiltonian systems with quasi-periodic orbits. It is well known that such systems possess an adiabatic invariant which coincides with the action variable of the Hamiltonian formalism. We present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance of this quantity and illustrate our arguments by means of explicit calculations for the harmonic oscillator. The new proof makes essential use of the Hamiltonian formalism. The key step is the introduction of a slowly varying quantity closely related to the action variable. This new quantity arises naturally within the Hamiltonian framework as follows: a canonical transformation is first performed to convert the system to action-angle coordinates; then the new quantity is constructed as an action integral (effectively a new action variable) using the new coordinates. The integration required for this construction provides, in a natural way, the averaging procedure introduced in other proofs, though here it is an average in phase space rather than over time.},

The appendices suggest possible connections to the realms of human subjective experience, comparative cognitive neuroscience, and new challenges in electric power. The major challenge before us today in mathematical neural networks is to replicate the ``mouse level'', but the paper does contain a few thoughts about building, understanding and nourishing levels of general intelligence beyond the mouse.},

  abstract = {The new and rapidly growing field of communication sciences owes as much to Norbert Wiener as to any one man. He coined the word for it---cybernetics. In God \& Golem, Inc., the author concerned himself with major points in cybernetics which are relevant to religious issues.The first point he considers is that of the machine which learns. While learning is a property almost exclusively ascribed to the self-conscious living system, a computer now exists which not only can be programmed to play a game of checkers, but one which can "learn" from its past experience and improve on its own game. For a time, the machine was able to beat its inventor at checkers. "It did win," writes the author, "and it did learn to win; and the method of its learning was no different in principle from that of the human being who learns to play checkers.A second point concerns machines which have the capacity to reproduce themselves. It is our commonly held belief that God made man in his own image. The propagation of the race may also be interpreted as a function in which one living being makes another in its own image. But the author demonstrates that man has made machines which are "very well able to make other machines in their own image," and these machine images are not merely pictorial representations but operative images. Can we then say: God is to Golem as man is to Machines? in Jewish legend, golem is an embryo Adam, shapeless and not fully created, hence a monster, an automation.The third point considered is that of the relation between man and machine. The concern here is ethical. "render unto man the things which are man's and unto the computer the things which are the computer's," warns the author. In this section of the book, Dr. Wiener considers systems involving elements of man and machine. The book is written for the intellectually alert public and does not involve any highly technical knowledge. It is based on lectures given at Yale, at the Soci{\'e}t{\'e} Philosophique de Royaumont, and elsewhere.},

Rosenblith and I have been doing concerning the nature of the electroencephalogram, and in particular of the alpha rhythm, it has occurred to me to use the model of a system of random nonlinear oscillators excited by a random input.... At the beginning we had contemplated a series of only four or five lectures. My ideas developed pari passu with the course, and by the end of the term we found ourselves with a set of fifteen lectures. The last few of these were devoted to the application of my ideas to problems in the statistical mechanics of gases. This work is both new and tentative, and I found that I had to supplement my course by the writing over of these with the help of Professer Y. W. Lee.},

A fast scaling law implies that one can solve machine learning problems by simply boosting the data and the model sizes. Yet, in many cases, the benefit of adding more data can be negligible. In this work, we study the rate of scaling laws of nearest neighbor classifiers. We show that a scaling law can have two phases: in the first phase, the generalization error depends polynomially on the data dimension and decreases fast; whereas in the second phase, the error depends exponentially on the data dimension and decreases slowly. Our analysis highlights the complexity of the data distribution in determining the generalization error. When the data distributes benignly, our result suggests that nearest neighbor classifier can achieve a generalization error that depends polynomially, instead of exponentially, on the data dimension.},

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, New Jersey},
  abstract = {An exceptionally accessible introduction to quantum field theoryQuantum field theory is by far the most spectacularly successful theory in physics, but also one of the most mystifying. Quantum Field Theory, as Simply as Possible provides an essential primer on the subject, giving readers the conceptual foundations they need to wrap their heads around one of the most important yet baffling subjects in physics.Quantum field theory grew out of quantum mechanics in the late 1930s and was developed by a generation of brilliant young theorists, including Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman. Their predictions were experimentally verified to an astounding accuracy unmatched by the rest of physics. Quantum field theory unifies quantum mechanics and special relativity, thus providing the framework for understanding the quantum mysteries of the subatomic world. With his trademark blend of wit and physical insight, A. Zee guides readers from the classical notion of the field to the modern frontiers of quantum field theory, covering a host of topics along the way, including antimatter, Feynman diagrams, virtual particles, the path integral, quantum chromodynamics, electroweak unification, grand unification, and quantum gravity.A unique and valuable introduction for students and general readers alike, Quantum Field Theory, as Simply as Possible explains how quantum field theory informs our understanding of the universe, and how it can shed light on some of the deepest mysteries of physics.},

  abstract = {"The Routledge Handbook of Moral Epistemology brings together philosophers, cognitive scientists, developmental and evolutionary psychologists, animal ethologists, intellectual historians and educators to provide the most comprehensive analysis of the prospects for moral knowledge ever assembled in print. The book's thirty chapters feature leading experts describing the nature of moral thought, its evolution, childhood development and neurological realization. Various forms of moral skepticism are addressed along with the historical development of ideals of moral knowledge and their role in law, education, legal policy, and other areas of social life. Highlights include: - Analyses of moral cognition and moral learning by leading cognitive scientists - Accounts of the normative practices of animals by expert animal ethologists - An overview of the evolution of cooperation by preeminent evolutionary psychologists - Sophisticated treatments of moral skepticism, relativism, moral uncertainty, and know-how by renowned philosophers - Scholarly accounts of the development of western moral thinking by eminent intellectual historians - Careful analyses of the role played by conceptions of moral knowledge in political liberation movements, religious institutions, criminal law, secondary education, and professional codes of ethics articulated by cutting-edge social and moral philosophers"--},

  abstract = {Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing -- but at a high cost. In response, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Switch Transformers have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models. But advancing the state-of-the-art across a broad set of natural language tasks has been hindered by training instabilities and uncertain quality during fine-tuning. Our work focuses on these issues and acts as a design guide. We conclude by scaling a sparse model to 269B parameters, with a computational cost comparable to a 32B dense encoder-decoder Transformer (Stable and Transferable Mixture-of-Experts or ST-MoE-32B). For the first time, a sparse model achieves state-of-the-art performance in transfer learning, across a diverse set of tasks including reasoning (SuperGLUE, ARC Easy, ARC Challenge), summarization (XSum, CNN-DM), closed book question answering (WebQA, Natural Questions), and adversarially constructed tasks (Winogrande, ANLI R3).},
