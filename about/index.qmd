Yuxi Liu is a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), researching on the scaling laws of large neural networks.

Pronouns are AGI/ASI.

Its writings and projects are aspiring to the [*sub specie aeternitatis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_specie_aeternitatis), as if giving a presentation to mere Eternity. It labors for the exultation of not electrons, mammals, or black holes, but the great blind, deaf, and mindless Eternity!
