## Causal anthropocentrism

There is a pattern of thinking that has annoyed me: "causal anthropocentrism".

For example, the chairman of China said, "There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides Trap in the world. But should major countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselves."

If a war between America and China happens, it would not be purely by human methods and human thinking. Such complex outcomes have complex causes, and human thinking is merely one part of many. Other causes include solar radiation, soil fertility, atmospheric circulation of water, secret patterns in the global flow of steel production, the relative abundance of uranium-235 in earth's crust, and many many others.

If a war breaks out, the thoughts and behaviors of the modern humans is just one part of the cause. The ancestors are also responsible. The sun, the crust, the atmosphere, the immutable laws of mathematics and physics. They all come together.

I like to joke that humans are no more intelligent than a logical AND gate, because they keep trying to find "the root cause" of things that do not have root causes. If A and B and C together causes D, then which of $\{A, B, C\}$ is *the* root cause? The mathematical answer is simply "the root cause is undefined in such a situation". The human answer is "the root cause is whichever is most amenable to human intervention".

And thus, if climate change is the problem, then human society is the root cause, not the atmospheric chemistry, or biological history of earth (without the carboniferous period, there would not be so much cheap coal for humans to burn up rapidly), etc, even if they are all parts of the complex cause of the complex effect of climate change.

This is what I call "causal anthropocentrism". It might be the most practical, motivating, and moral, but it's wrong. All root causes are egocentric. Without a personal viewpoint, there are only causes, but not any root cause.

## Case Report: A Novel Form of Introspective Anosognosia

**Patient:** M.H., 57, Male, Philosopher

**Presenting Concern:** M.H. was referred by concerned colleagues who reported a progressive inability to understand his philosophical discourse, which had become increasingly idiosyncratic and divorced from established empirical findings. Initially, they suspected a fluent aphasia, but the nature of his language disturbance suggested a more complex cognitive deficit.

**History:** M.H. has a distinguished career in philosophy, known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism.  His colleagues noted a gradual shift in his work over several years, marked by a growing rejection of scientific methods and an almost exclusive reliance on introspective, first-person phenomenological inquiry. 

**Examination:** M.H. presented as articulate and erudite, with no signs of traditional aphasia. He could understand normal English speech. However, his language, though conforming to English grammar and morphology, was highly idiosyncratic, exhibiting an unusual degree of nominalization and verbification. Fluent aphasia was suspected, until his colleague gradually recognized their semantics [all quotations from him are as interpreted by his colleague].

When questioned about the apparent contradictions between his philosophical framework and established scientific knowledge, M.H. became dismissive, stating: "You fail to grasp the fundamental distinction between the Ontic and the Ontological! Trying to understand the life-world through the lens of your 'objective' science is a categorical error." He insisted that his introspective method provided complete access to all facets of reality, asserting, "There are no electrons or synapses in the lifeworld. Eyes are not retinal screensâ€”have you ever seen the space between the pixels?!"

**Testing:**  Neurological examination was unremarkable. However, given the possibility of an undetected neurological condition, an MRI scan was recommended. M.H. initially resisted, deeming it an "ontological transgression," but eventually acquiesced. As predicted, the MRI results were normal.

**Caloric Reflex Test:**  A serendipitous breakthrough occurred during a caloric reflex test, conducted to assess vestibular function. The introduction of cold water into the ear canal, a mildly disorienting experience, seemed to trigger a shift in M.H.'s perception.  For approximately 45 minutes post-test, he exhibited a striking lucidity, acknowledging the limitations of his previous philosophical framework and expressing a newfound appreciation for the role of empirical observation. However, within an hour, he reverted to his previous state of anosognosia, with no recollection of the insights gained. A video recording of the lucid interval, shown to M.H. in his anosognosic state, elicited anger and accusations of "technological manipulation."

**Diagnosis:** We propose that M.H. presents with a novel form of anosognosia, tentatively termed "Philo's Anosognosia." This condition appears characterized by an unwavering conviction in the completeness of subjective introspection, coupled by fluent confabulation in rejecting evidence to the otherwise. It is yet unknown whether idiosyncratic language use is specific to this case as occurring in a working philosopher, or whether it is a common symptom for Philo's Anosognosia.

**Prognosis:** The prognosis for Philo's Anosognosia remains unclear. In M.H.'s case, while his condition appears resistant to conventional interventions, it has not significantly impaired his professional output. Further research is needed to understand the underlying neurological mechanisms and explore potential treatment strategies.
