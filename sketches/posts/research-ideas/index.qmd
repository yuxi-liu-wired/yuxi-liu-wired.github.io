## Statistics

### Correlation gradient ascends to causation

The idea is that by gradient-ascending correlation, we would eventually arrive at a high-correlation pair of variables, which should be quite causally related. Naively, this is false. If the basic structure is a complex causal diagram, then a local maximum for $\argmax_Y R_{XY}$ might be where $Y$ is far downstream of $X$, and connected by many weak paths.

However, there was a case-report that it works in biochemistry, where the following sequence was used to discover how to chemically induce meiosis ([*Meiosis is all you need*, Metacelsus 2022](https://denovo.substack.com/p/meiosis-is-all-you-need)):

1. Take a diploid cell line (probably ESC or iPSC or PGCLC)
2. Induce meiosis and form many haploid cell lines.
3. Genotype the haploid lines and select the best ones.
4. Fuse two haploid cells to re-generate a diploid cell line.
5. Repeat as desired. At the end, either differentiate the cells into oocytes or perform nuclear transfer into a donor oocyte.

What I think *might* work out is if we find $X, Y$ such that $\nabla_X r_{X,Y} = 0$ and $\nabla_Y r_{X,Y} = 0$, where the gradient $\nabla$ does not literally mean $d/dx$, but rather, what happens if we move from $X$ to an adjacent variable. However, what is "adjacent"? We can't say that "adjacent" means "directly connected on the causal graph" because if we know the causal graph, then our problem is solved!
